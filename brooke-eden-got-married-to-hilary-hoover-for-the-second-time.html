On August 27, the couple married in a legal ceremony at a church in Nashville, which was attended by their parents and siblings.&nbsp;The second wedding ceremony, held at the Paradisus Playa del Carmen resort in Del Carmen, Mexico, drew 140 guests, including relatives and friends. In an interview, the pair revealed that they were unable to spend much time together since their families were so far apart. When asked about the first wedding, they answered,</p><p>“Because we needed to be legally married in the United States before going to Mexico, we felt a Nashville ceremony with our families would be the ideal opportunity for our families to unite.”</p><p>Along with the other family members, the newlywed couple reported that Hoover’s nieces and nephews, as well as Eden’s niece, became best friends.</p><p>“The whole of our family, including Hilary’s nieces and nephew, became great friends with Brooke’s niece (our flower girl and ring bearer). We’ve received so much love and support from family and friends that we wanted to celebrate with everyone.”</p><p>Brooke Eden chose the same costume she wore for the Love Inc. magazine cover photo, created by Savin London. Consider the Wldflwrs, a Nashville-based ring business that provided the rings, and they performed a playlist of the finest songs from the 1990s throughout the ceremony. Following there came a mother-daughter and father-daughter dance, as well as a speech by Eden’s niece, Colbee. The couple danced to Eden and Ricky Martin’s Livin’ La Vida Loca, a song composed and produced by Eden and Ricky Martin.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brooke-Eden-1.jpg alt="Brooke Eden" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Everything there is to know about&nbsp;Brooke&nbsp;Eden</h2><p>Brooke Eden auditioned for American Idol’s seventh and tenth seasons. She rose to prominence with the release of her song “American Dreamin,” and she signed with Red Bow Records in 2015.&nbsp;Eden grew interested in music as a child after seeing her father play as a drummer in a local country band. She used to open for groups like Alan Jackson and Brooks & Dunn at local music festivals. She graduated from Wellington High School in 2007 and went on to win the title of Miss South Florida in a regional beauty pageant the following year.</p><p>Brooke then auditioned for American Idol’s seventh season and made it to Hollywood week before being eliminated before the live rounds. She auditioned again for the show’s tenth season but was unable to advance. In 2014, the 33-year-old published a self-titled EP. Her song, American Dream, garnered excellent acclaim the same year. In 2015, she released a song called Daddy’s Money, which peaked at number 50 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart. Eden then followed up with another EP, Welcome to the Weekend. She maintained her tremendous career with hits such as Act Like You Don’t, No Shade, Sunroof, and others.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brooke-Eden.jpg alt="Brooke Eden" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Brooke Eden and Hilary Hoover’s relationship</h2><p>Brooke Eden started dating Hillary Hoover in 2015. At the time, Hoover was employed by Eden’s record company. Eden was born in January 2021, and the couple married in May of that year.&nbsp;Three months into their romance, the pair announced that they started living together. They also have a pet and own three properties. Eden and Hoover both said that they felt “this was it” from the start, and that after coming out publicly, they knew they wanted to make it official. They said that they are real partners, saying,</p><p>“We help each other and try to remember that we’re all on the same team.” Even when we’re arguing, we always kiss each other good night. We worked so hard to be together, and we’re happy than ever. Remembering everything we’ve been through assures us that we’ll get through anything together.”</p><p>The pair feels like they’ve been married for years and are overjoyed to have their marriage acknowledged by the law. They are planning a honeymoon in Italy and Spain.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Brooke Eden</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Hilary Hoover</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZq6efoLJuscOepWafn6l6rq3Rq6CenF2pvG60yKWYq7FdnbywwsSrZJ%2BnomLBqbGMrJycp56ZerW1zJ5m</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./doreen-ketchens.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Doreen Ketchens net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
