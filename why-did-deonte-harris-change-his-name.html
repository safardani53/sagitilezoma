The current <a href=#>NFL</a> player has already been on some of the most recognized teams, including the <a href=#>New Orleans Saints</a> and the <a href=#>Buffalo Bills</a>.</p><p>But, aside from the number on his jersey, his last name has also seen a transformation. Did he get married? Is it for a more personal reason? Here is the reason behind the change.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The NFL's Deonte Harris changed his last name to Harty.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>In 2022, the player announced that he was going to be changing his last name from Harris to Harty. It's not a drastic change in theory, but in football, that is a big deal.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When it comes to sports, most of your fanbase either knows you by your number or your last name. This transformation can be a lot for sports fans to adjust to. But in Deonte's eyes, it's well worth it because changing his name honors his stepfather.</p><p>"It's always been a thought I've had and now seemed like the perfect time to do it. That is my guy, that is my hero. For me, it is an honor for him to accept me as his son, accept my brothers, and for him to let me take his name so I can pass it down to my kids. It is just major," Deonte explained <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in a press junket</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Deonte Harty has a child with his girlfriend.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>To answer that question: He is in a relationship with micro-influencer Ashley Ellis. The couple have one child together, a daughter named Zola. Ashley constantly posts pictures of her on her Instagram for her nearly 5,000 followers.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NOLA</a>, Deonte and Ashley tragically suffered a miscarriage back in 2021 before giving birth to Zola, making her their rainbow baby.

But, when it comes to family, Deonte always finds a way to have that quality time, even in unexpected circumstances.</p><p>In 2022, he suffered a pretty intense toe injury that took him off the field for a long time. While fans did miss him in the games, the bright side to this was that he got to be home with Zola more than usual.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"My daughter just made everything better, and my family, obviously. I think that was just God giving me the time I needed to spend with her. You get to watch your child grow up every day. I might be going to rehab for a couple of hours but I’m coming right back and she’s just right there," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rochester First</a>.</p><p>Even though his stepfather is not in the limelight, he must be proud that Deonte will be carrying on his last name and his legacy — especially when he scores a touchdown.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aclaS7tbGMoZirqpmoeqS0wKeenmWYnsBuusCmnA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./amy-roloff-ditches-chris-marek-sparks-wild-divorce-speculation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amy Roloff Ditches Chris Marek, Sparks Wild Divorce Speculation">&larr;
