Personal Life Insight With Married And Wife Details</a></p><p>Jeff and Colton first crossed their paths&nbsp;in an airport in October 2017, while Jeff was standing with his assistant in line and ran into the celeb florist. He hit&nbsp;him in the back with his Louis Vuitton bag.</p><p>The duo&nbsp;ended up sharing the same flight, where&nbsp;they both&nbsp;passed Post-It notes back and forth and also each other's numbers. Soon, the trip turned romantic as they cuddled each other and&nbsp;a day after, Jeff made the romantic gesture of sending flowers to Colton's home quoting,&nbsp;“What movies are made of.”</p><p>The duo was supposed to meet for a date years back ago, in&nbsp;2013&nbsp;as&nbsp;their&nbsp;two mutual friends,&nbsp;event planner Val Vogt and tennis star Serena Williams set up for a date for the two.&nbsp;Jeff was a Paris resident back then while the&nbsp;American actor was in Vancouver shooting for&nbsp;Arrow at the time, so they decided not to cancel the date. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And the sweetest proposal came in March 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeff, age 46, popped the question under fireworks&nbsp;in Las Ventanas al Paraiso, Mexico and asked Colton, his boyfriend, to exchange the marriage vows with him. He even took his proposal moment to Instagram stating that Colton said "Yes" to the proposal.</p><p><strong>Inserting:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Andrew Napolitano: Married Man Or, Gay?

Sharing an&nbsp; Instagram&nbsp;image on 10 October 2017, he opened&nbsp;to his followers that the two planned to wed at the end of the month. He posted few snaps with Colton while sharing how blessed he is to have him in his life.

The married couple made their last public appearance together in March 2018. And the divorce rumors got stronger when the Teen Wolf actor deleted the pair's&nbsp;several pictures&nbsp;from his Instagram.</p><p>It became more than obvious after Colton,&nbsp;who enjoys the&nbsp;net worth of $4 million,&nbsp;dropped the word "husband" from his bio, changing his name from Haynes-Leatham back to Haynes.</p><p>Finally, the rumors became a reality after Colton filed for divorce on 8 May 2018 in Los Angeles citing&nbsp;irreconcilable differences,&nbsp;cause for their&nbsp;divorce. As per the source,&nbsp;their relationship went off track some time ago, and Colton felt that Jeff pulled him away from his friends and felt like losing himself in the process. The insider stated,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"Through their relationship, Jeff pulled Colton away from his friends and Colton really started to lose himself."</p><p>Colton, who ended their&nbsp;seven months marriage,&nbsp;has&nbsp;even asked the judge to terminate spousal support&nbsp;for both of them and demanded the both to pay their own attorney's fees.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, the seven months married couple seems to have pulled the plug off&nbsp;their relationship.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Love Finds It’s Way Back Again In The Life Of Jeff Leatham&nbsp;</strong></h2><p dir=ltr>Many people were shocked by the sudden split of the couple as they were seen genuinely in love since they were together in a relationship. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="CBSâ€™ Errol Barnett Wiki: From Gay Rumors To Complete Biography" rel=follow>CBS’ Errol Barnett Wiki: From Gay Rumors To Complete Biography</a></p><p>Back in March of 2018, the sudden death of Colton's mom caused significant turmoil in their marriage. It is said when a person is in grief, he/she tries to create more misery in their life as a result of vulnerability. Losing someone as close as mother made him very vulnerable and impulsively he ended things with Jeff too soon. Soon after losing his mother, Colton started creating distance from his inner circle and started isolating himself, even from Jeff.</p><p>But by September, Colton and Jeff began wearing their wedding rings on their finger which was a complete shock for their fans. It seems like both had a real strong bond after the loss of his mother. Moreover, the couple is getting better day by day as they continue to heal from the loss of a family member.</p><p>Moreover, the love they had for each other brought the couple back even during the hard times. Furthermore, Jeff and Colton found a way to work their relationship, and they are only going more stronger from here. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2Byp7KMpZyarJiWum6txp5ksJ2Umbavs4ydoK%2BnopiybrTUrJmappRitKLFjJugq6yYma66ecGipmaan66zs7XEp5tmnpGitq3FjKecrWWnpL%2B1tI2hq6ak</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./keith-pichardo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Keith Pichardo- Biography, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Dating">&larr;
