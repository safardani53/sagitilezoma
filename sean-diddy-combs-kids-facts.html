He grew up and proved himself to be an exceptional student and leader at Howard University, where he majored in business administration before dropping out to pursue a career at Uptown Records in the early 1990s.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since then, Diddy has released several albums; founded his own record label, Bad Boy Records; helped launch the careers of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mary J.

In 2022, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Diddy was honored</a> at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>BET Awards</a> with the Lifetime Achievement Award, which honors Black musicians who have significantly shaped the industry culture, become a leader in their field and inspired generations of people.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September 2023, Diddy was honored again when he was given the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Global Icon Award</a> at the VMAs. Justin, Christian, Chance, D'Lila and Jessie were present to celebrate their father on stage and on the pink carpet before the ceremony.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Learn more about Diddy's family below.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-quincy-taylor-brown-32></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Quincy Taylor Brown, 32</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Taylor Hill/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Quincy was born in New York City on June 4, 1991, to model <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kim Porter</a> and singer, songwriter and record producer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Al B. Sure!</a>. He was named after his godfather, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Quincy Jones</a>, who was Al B. Sure!'s mentor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Quincy was three, his mother began a relationship with Diddy, who eventually adopted Quincy. Diddy and Porter, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>who died in 2018</a>, went on to have four more children together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking with PEOPLE in April 2023, Quincy shared how important it is to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>keep his mother's legacy alive</a>. "I'm my mom's son, so therefore there's so much life for me to expand on off of her life. And that journey hasn't even started yet, which is the best part about it. What my mom's legacy is representative of is beyond words. That's gonna really come to life soon."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Today, Quincy is an actor, singer and model — and he credits much of his ambitious spirit to his father. He previously opened up to PEOPLE about how the hip-hop mogul's never-ending hustle <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>inspired him to pursue his own endeavors</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think I've been a sponge, and now I do so much," Quincy told PEOPLE of his father. "I'm very much into the art of acting, and then there's music. But just seeing how he's able to handle and juggle all these things, I took that from him as my most major takeaway."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, Quincy has proven himself a talented rapper, having dropped more than 10 singles, including "Friends First" with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>French Montana</a> and "Blue Dot." In 2017, Quincy and Al B Sure! released "I Can Tell You," a cover of the R&B legend's 1988 song "Nite and Day"; that same year, Quincy issued his first solo project, an EP titled This Is for You.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Taking after Diddy, Quincy also works in managing and developing fresh talent — starting with his twin sisters, D'Lila and Jessie, whom he featured in the music video for his 2022 song "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Face Off</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We don't need no contracts, no paper, but I'm my sisters' manager," he told PEOPLE. "I'm like, the uncle-dad-manager-protector; I'm claiming it. I want to be able to really guide them. I want them to really know the layers of everything you can do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When he isn't making music or modeling, Quincy is building his acting credits, having appeared in films like We the Party (2012), Brotherly Love (2015) and The Holiday Calendar (2018). On TV, he costarred in the TV musical drama Star, portrayed Crown on Power Book III: Raising Kanan and narrated the Paramount+ series Family Legacy.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-justin-combs-29></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Justin Combs, 29</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Cassidy Sparrow/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Justin — Diddy's first child with stylist and fashion designer Misa Hylton — was born in New York on Dec. 30, 1993. He gained international popularity in 2008 when he was shown on MTV's My Super Sweet 16 with his father.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Justin attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he earned a bachelor's degree in sociology while playing as a defensive back for the UCLA Bruins football team on a scholarship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2016, Justin graduated from UCLA and became the first of the Combs family to graduate college. "First Combs male to graduate from College.. All praise to God & my parents!" he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote on Instagram</a> with a photo of him wearing his cap and gown while posing with family, including Hylton and Diddy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hylton also celebrated her son's achievement on social media with a picture of her and Diddy sitting in the crowd at the graduation ceremony, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>captioning the Instagram post</a>: "The proud parents!!! @iamdiddy With @fonzbentley in the cut 😎 #uclagraduate2016 @princejdc we are so proud of you and love you so much!!!!!!"<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The day after Justin's college graduation, Diddy also congratulated his son in a now-deleted Instagram post, writing: "Never stop dreaming or believing!!

He most notably appeared in season three of Power Book II: Ghost as the character King and hosted the 2021 TV series, Respectfully Justin, interviewing celebrity guests like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Saweetie</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Chris Brown</a> and others.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up to date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-christian-combs-25></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Christian Combs, 25</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Frazer Harrison/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Christian — Diddy and Porter's first biological child together — was born on April 1, 1998, soon after his mom and dad started dating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Christian, a musical artist who goes by the name King Combs, began his music career shortly after finishing high school. In 2019, he released the EP Cyncerely, C3, which features songs like "Heaven Sent" and "Naughty"; Christian also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>collaborated with his brother Quincy</a> on the song "Options" that same year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although he was inspired by his father, Christian knew since childhood that he wanted to be a performer and began mixing rap and R&B styles to make his own sound.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's really <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>always been something I wanted to do</a>," Christian told PEOPLE in September 2022. "There have been times when my dad questioned me and asked, 'What's your plan B? Are you sure you want to do this?' and I'm like, 'There is no plan B.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked about the biggest lesson Christian has learned from his dad, he told PEOPLE: "I would say the biggest lesson is never stop.

That's what it is."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Christian's hard work and determination to become a successful rapper paid off with the release of his smash hit song "Can't Stop Won't Stop" featuring <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kodak Black</a>. The track marked a career high for Christian in November 2022, reaching No. 1 on Billboard's Mainstream R&B Hip-Hop Airplay chart — the first chart-topper of his career.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from working on his music, Christian has also appeared on multiple TV shows, including Wild 'N Out, Making the Band and The Crew League.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-chance-combs-17></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Chance Combs, 17</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mike Coppola/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chance was born on July 20, 2006, to Diddy and businesswoman Sarah Chapman, who had been a friend of Diddy's for years, although the pair never openly dated. After learning of Chance's birth, Porter felt <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Diddy had betrayed her</a> during their long-term, on-and-off relationship, prompting her to end things with the rapper. Diddy and Chapman are still in communication as co-parents to Chance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chance has been actively involved in giving back to those in need. In January 2021, amid the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>COVID-19</a> pandemic, she joined her sisters D'Lila and Jessie in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>donating customized beauty and skincare products</a> to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Alexandria House</a> in Los Angeles, which offers safe and supportive housing for women and children in the process of moving from emergency shelter into permanent living.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We know how truly blessed we are, and our parents have taught us the importance of helping others," the sisters told PEOPLE in a statement.

"I'm speechless — I am speechless.

Despite the rift between their parents, D'Lila and Jessie were raised alongside their sister Chance.
