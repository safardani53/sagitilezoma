People born in the year of the tiger are self-sufficient and have great self-esteem. They adore being the defender and leader of ordinary people. They are passionate about justice and will never give up an argument. Their main flaw is their recklessness, which causes them to fail. They never, however, genuinely fail. Tigers will always find a way to recover and triumph in the end.</p><p>People born on July 11 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Cancer</strong>. Cancer, as represented by the crab, smoothly glides between sea and beach, symbolizing cancer's capacity to dwell in both emotional and material realms.

However, like the hard-shelled crabs, this water sign is eager to go to any length to defend itself emotionally.
