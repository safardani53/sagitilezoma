Though the estranged spouses <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>confirmed they split</a>, are they actually getting a divorce? Keep reading to find out everything we know about Kyle and Mauricio’s separation and where they stand today.</p><h2>Are Kyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky Getting Divorced?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>In early July, reports surfaced claiming that the <i>Halloween</i> actress and the real estate broker split. The pair took to Instagram to clarify what their marital status was.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“In regards to the news that came out about us today … any claims regarding divorcing are untrue,” they wrote in a statement. “However, yes, we have had a rough year. The most challenging one of our marriage. But we both love and respect each other tremendously. There has been no wrongdoing on anyone’s part, [sic].”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In the months to come, fans speculated whether or not Kyle was in a relationship with her friend, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Morgan Wade</b></a>. However, Kyle, Mauricio and Morgan have shut down the rumors.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In late September, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mauricio caused confusion</a> among his inner circle and the public when he said he and Kyle “certainly” were “not separated” and “not divorced at this point” during an appearance on the “Red Mic” podcast. Less than a week later, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he clarified</a> what he meant to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“Kyle and I are human beings, OK? We have emotions, we have feelings, we’re going through a really hard time, OK?” Mauricio told the outlet, before adding, “We are currently separated, we are not talking about divorce and we’re trying to deal with this stuff internally with ourselves privately.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The founder of The Agency continued, “When I answered the question on that podcast about where we stand, the question was did Kyle and I plant the story to create ratings in order to create all kinds of different things. And the answer was we did not plant the story.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>In several separate interviews with other outlets throughout October, Mauricio doubled down on his comments. Though he and Kyle “are currently separated,” he claimed that they “are not throwing in the towel” on their marriage.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>Later that week, Bravo released the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>emotional trailer</a> for season 13 of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i></a>, and it revealed Kyle crying over their separation.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>While speaking with <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Watch What Happens Live</a>, Kyle admitted that the idea to separate “originated” from her.</p><h2>Why Did Kyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky Separate?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Neither Kyle nor Mauricio have explained the reason behind their split. However, the original report from <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>PEOPLE</i></a> in July alleged that they had been “separated for a while now but [were] still living under the same roof.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>In the dramatic <i>RHOBH</i> trailer, the estranged spouses were seen sitting down with their daughters, Farrah, Alexia and Sophia, seemingly to tell them about their separation.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“We are a very strong family, and we always will be,” Kyle tearfully insisted. “Always will be. Nothing can change that.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Are Kyle Richards and Mauricio Umanksy Still Married?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>As of now, the spouses are still legally married, but they are separated. During an interview with <i><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>, </i>Mauricio revealed that he and Kyle are still “fighting” to save their marriage.<span class=Apple-converted-space> However, on October 12, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a> ran photos of Kyle stepping out at a Home Goods in Beverly Hills, sans wedding ring, lending legitimacy to increased speculation that the couple is over.&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Days earlier, on October 6, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rumors emerged</a> that Maurcio and real estate pro <strong>Leslie Bega</strong> are dating. The speculation came after Mauricio’s mom <strong>Estella Sneider&nbsp;</strong>shared a photo at dinner of Mauricio’s father <strong>Eduardo</strong>, along with Mauricio and Leslie, after a taping of Dancing With The Stars. In the snap, the brunette beauty rested her arm on Mauricio’s shoulder and smiled. Mauricio, too, appeared to be thrilled in the photo. Another pic showed all four standing together.&nbsp; “Dinner at Il Pastaio after&nbsp;Dancing With The Stars!” Estella, who’s divorced from Eduardo, captioned the photos in part.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>On October 9, however, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ </a>dropped a bombshell report that it’s not Mauricio dating Leslie — it’s his father, Eduardo! The outlet reported that it, “turns out Leslie went to the show with her date — Mauricio’s dad,&nbsp;<strong>Eduardo Umansky</strong>.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>On October 24, 2023, Twitter user @TheBravoBabe_ shared an astute observation. “<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Update: Kyle deleted all her DWTS support posts from her Instagram,” the account Tweeted, along with a wide-eyes emoji. Indeed, Kyle had shared a post in September showing support for Mauricio as he competed on DWTS,&nbsp;which is absent from her verified account. In it, she shared a promo pic of Mauricio and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Emma Slater</strong></a>, his dancing partner, and educated fans on how to vote multiple times.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-24>However, he’d been seen holding hands in public with Emma on October 22 after dining together in Beverly Hills, per TMZ. Photos were <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>published by the outlet</a> just one day before Kyle deleted the support posts.</p><p id=content-paragraph-25>Most recently, on November 14, 2023, Kyle slammed rumors that she made up the drama in her marriage to generate views for RHOBH. “What human being would create a story like this?” she said on Bravo Executive Producer <strong>Alex Baskin</strong>‘s&nbsp;podcast&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bravo’s Hot Mic</a>. “No offense, Alex. I love you and everybody with the show. Who would do that for ratings? Put their family through this. That is one of the dumbest things I’ve maybe ever heard in these 13 years. I’m going to pretend that I’m separated and torture my children? So that people tune in?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-26>Kyle then continued and noted that she has been on the show for 13 seasons and doesn’t need the drama to impress anyone, as reported by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>. “When people talk about, ‘Oh, they do these things to be relevant,’ I’m already on the show 13 years,” she quipped. “I care about being relevant to my friends and family. Yes, I’m on television, but I’m good. I’m not looking to be more relevant. I would never put my family through this ever.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-29>In December 2023, Kyle and Mauricio gave mixed signals about the status of their marriage again when they happily posed for a holiday-themed photo with their kids, which can be seen above. Their daughter, <strong>Alexia</strong>, who was also in the photo alongside her parents, shared the photo to social media and it featured her sister, <strong>Sophia</strong>, and her half-sister, <strong>Farrah Aldjufrie</strong>, as well. The photo appeared to be taken at The Grove shopping center in Los Angeles, where they seemed to have a great time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-30>The ambiguity seemingly continued as the RHOBH beauty took to Instagram to share images on the slopes with Mauricio and her four daughters, indicating they spent the holiday together. In the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>December 26, 2023 reel</a>, Kyle shared a family pic on the slopes as all four daughters were bundled up in ski gear with Mauricio standing to the far left. Kyle also shared several pics of herself and her daughters dressed up to enjoy their snowy getaway.</p><p id=content-paragraph-31>“Hoping you all had a merry Christmas,” Kyle captioned the reel alongside festive emojis. “To my 4 daughters, you bring me happiness every day. Thank you for all the love & laughter and for loving each other the way you do. That’s the best gift I could ever receive.”</p><h2>Do Kyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky Have a Prenup?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-32>Amid all the drama, comments that Kyle made about whether or not the couple had a prenup during a 2017&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Then & Now</a>&nbsp;interview have resurfaced. Kyle explained why they didn’t have one when they got married. “My husband and I didn’t have two nickels to rub together when we got married, so a prenup was not an option or even talked about,” she said. “If I were to marry somebody who had less money than me, I would probably make them sign a prenup, but if I were getting married to somebody with a lot of money, no I wouldn’t sign one.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8CrnGajqaGybr7InJ%2BaqpSoeqK6w2akmq2inrCqu4yupJqmo6DGbrPErauippdisarCzquanpxdqbWmtdFmqqmkmal6dn2WaW9qaF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jasper-philipsen.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Jasper Philipsen net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
