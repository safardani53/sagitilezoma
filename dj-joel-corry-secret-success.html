But you’ve got to do it.</p><p>“I keep a very positive mindset and stay as healthy as possible on the road, which helps a lot.</p><p>“A lot of DJs get caught up in the party side of it and that’s when you can burn out.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Bizarre">Read More on Bizarre</h2><p>“I’m making sensible decisions and trying to keep health as a priority.</p><p>“Keeping my fitness routine is how I can stay grounded when I tour around the world.</p><p>“Over the years, it’s gone from going to the gym for a good body to going to the gym because I want to feel good.”</p><p>Today sees the release of his debut album, Another Friday Night, packed with tunes including Lonely, Sorry and his No1 MNEK collaboration Head & Heart.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bizarre</h2></p><p>Speaking about the title track, also with MNEK, he teased: “It’s the first song we’ve done together since Head & Heart.</p><p>“His vocal is pitched up on it but that’s actually MNEK and I wrote the song with him.</p><p>“It embodies the vibe of the whole album.</p><p>“I want it to be the album you put on to start the party.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Mae wants to be jaded</h2><p><a href=#>MAE MULLER</a> wants to make a track with <a href=#>Jade Thirlwell</a>.</p><p>The Eurovision star only released her new album Sorry I’m Late last month but is already plotting her next move – revealing she’d love to collaborate with the <a href=#>Little Mix</a> singer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

all the right things and I’m a big fan of hers.</p><p>“It would be f***ing stunning.</p><p>Talking live on Facebook Mae added: “She’s always been so supportive of me and I’m excited to see what she does with her solo career.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Attitude from Al and Amanda</h2><p><a href=#>AMANDA HOLDEN</a> and <a href=#>Alan Carr</a> will be sure to bring the house down at Wednesday’s Attitude Awards.</p><p>The duo are hosting the 12th star-studded LGBTQIA+ event at the Camden Roundhouse in London.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/amanda-holden-alan-carr-850274700.jpg><p>Amanda said: “Since being crowned an ‘honorary gay’ in 2017, it’s always been a dream of mine to host the Attitude Awards.</p><p>“I couldn’t think of a better person to co-host with than my dear friend Alan Carr.</p><p>“It’s so important to stand together as one and embrace this beautifully diverse world we live in and accept everyone for who they are.</p><p>“I can’t wait to be surrounded by the community while dishing out the gongs.”</p><p>Comedian Alan added: “It’s been a mixed year for our LGBTQIA+ family.</p><p>“Some amazing progress has been made, yet some distressing setbacks have knocked us for six, which makes the awards even more important.</p><p>“I am thrilled to be hosting with one of my besties!</p><p>“The campest, most raucous night in the LGBTQIA+ calendar just got a bit more sparkle.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>OTT, Liam</h2><p>I WAS blown away after jetting to Las Vegas last week to see <a href=#>U2</a> open The Sphere.</p><p>But one person who hasn’t been won over by the state of the art venue is <a href=#>Liam Gallagher</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/liam-gallagher-performs-i-days-843397056.jpg><p>Preferring a simple guitar and drums set up over giant screens and mind warping visuals, the <a href=#>Oasis</a> rocker replied “bit over the top” when asked for his take by one fan online.</p><p>He’s always been far more at home in the local boozer with a pie and pint than living it large in Sin City if you ask me.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Mad's white on cue</h2><p><a href=#>MADISON BEER</a> has bagged her biggest UK gig to date – performing on <a href=#>Strictly Come Dancing</a>.</p><p>The American pop star, who looked gorgeous in a white mini-dress outside of the Radio 1 studios in London, will sing on the BBC dancing show this weekend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/splashnews-com-splash-news-pictures-850218975.jpg><p>A source said: “Madison is riding high at the moment and Strictly jumped at the chance to have her singing on the show.</p><p>“It is arguably the biggest British gig for Madison as the show gets millions of viewers, so it is a huge opportunity for her as she will be reaching an audience who may not have seen her before.”</p><p>Insiders previously told me how <a href=#>Leigh-Anne Pinnock</a> had also been approached to perform later this month.</p><p>Madison released her second album, Silence Between Songs, last month.</p><p>It features singles Home To Another One and Spinnin.</p><p>Madison said: “I’ve learned so much about myself and my artistry on the journey of the last two years since my last record.</p><p>“This album tells the story of so many different pieces of me that I discovered in the moments of pause where I settled down from the noise and learned the most about myself.</p><p>“I hope my fans are as inspired listening to it as I was when creating it.”</p><p><a href=#>ASHLEY ROBERTS</a> has found her happy place.</p><p>The former Pussycat Doll stuns as she takes to the dance floor in a metallic pink skirt and cropped cardigan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

green heels.</p><p>Yesterday Ashley was on hand to open pop up family activity venue Trolls Happy Place on London Piccadilly to celebrate the release of new film Trolls: Band Together.</p><p>Never one to miss a party, <a href=#>Rylan</a> took to the decks at the venue which is open to the public until Sunday.</p><p>The film, which stars <a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a> and <a href=#>Anna Kendrick</a>, is out October 20.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Rita and Robin will Be There</h2><p>IT’S been a busy year for <a href=#>Rita Ora</a> – and she has no plans to slow down for the rest of 2023.</p><p>I can reveal the chart topper has landed another massive collaboration, this time with dance floor legend Robin Schulz.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NINTCHDBPICT000845626066.jpg><p>Their track I’ll Be There, which also features Argentine rapper Tiago PZK, is due out later this month.</p><p>Rita is expected to announce the song in the coming days.</p><p>It comes just weeks after the You Only Love Men singer unveiled her massive global deal with Primark which featured her own collection with the high street giant.</p><p>It was only a few months ago that Rita released her third album You and I - peaking at No6 in the UK chart.</p><p>She’s already working on her fourth record - with a deluxe version of You and I also in the pipeline.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Nicola shows off her beckside</h2><p>I’M not too sure what to make of these odd snaps of <a href=#>Brooklyn Beckham</a> and his wife <a href=#>Nicola Peltz</a>.</p><p>The American beauty uploaded a string of shots from their hotel room in London – and they are worlds away from the preened-to-perfection wedding shoot they did with Vogue magazine last year.</p><img

up on the bed before holding an impromptu photoshoot in a maroon PVC jacket, keeping their room service dinner of pizza in the shot for good measure.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>Another image sees an unimpressed-looking Brooklyn drafted in to cradle her backside as she poses away.</p><p>The couple enjoyed a
