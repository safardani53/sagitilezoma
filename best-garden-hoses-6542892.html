PEOPLE tested 30 of the best garden hoses to help you narrow down the choices—and there are many good choices. Fifteen hoses (half of those we tested) scored an average of 4 out of 5 or higher across testing categories. Three hoses scored a perfect 5 out of 5, one of which topped our list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Jerry Gorchels, technical product representative at PanAmerican Seed North America, says the average consumer with watering needs should look for a couple of key elements in a garden hose. “Depending on their budget, they should look for one that is 25 feet longer than they feel [they need]. You always run short,” he tells PEOPLE. “Look for one that won't kink," he adds. "Some have a wire flex core that eliminates kinks. Hoses with a rubber lining and/or exterior have longevity.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for the best garden hoses PEOPLE tested in 2023 — varying in length, materials, and capabilities — in short, something for everyone.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-craftsman-58-in-x-50-ft-premium-duty-rubber-hose></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Craftsman Premium-Duty Rubber Hose</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="CRAFTSMAN 5/8-in x 50-ft Premium-Duty Rubber Hose" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/0yXj7l7FGkfMcJ-gu_6YUIXRca4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/craftsman-58-in-x-50-ft-premium-duty-rubber-hose-c2919019b3c4492c9171e7df44f9afef.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>&nbsp;Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Easy to maneuver around land or furniture</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Easy to screw on and off the spigot</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Doesn’t kink easily due to highly sturdy and durable material</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our overall winner was one of three hoses in our field of 30 that scored a perfect 5 out of 5 in each of our testing categories: design, ease of use, durability, and value. The CRAFTSMAN 50-ft red hose was solid and not lightweight, but not too heavy. We liked the red color and how this model is designed to hold up under rugged conditions. The red color will also make it stand out among the greens and browns in a typical yard or deck.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In our tests, the CRAFTSMAN hose was easy to maneuver and felt good in the hand and it was easy to screw on and off, thanks to its high quality brass threading. The hose also felt extremely durable, and didn’t kink a lot, whether empty or full. The price seems like a good deal for the product you get.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Length: </strong>50’ | <strong>Material:</strong> Rubber | <strong>Type of Couplings</strong>: Metal<br></p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="CRAFTSMAN 5/8-in x 50-ft Premium-Duty Rubber Hose coiled on a deck" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/HrenltlVNBuG3_pK91oRABSgDDU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO_CRAFTSMANPremiumDutyRubberRedHose_DB_010.jpg-0e13b74f8ac54c7086552666291ff7c9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=3759 data-sizes=750px alt="Hand holding the nozzle of a CRAFTSMAN 5/8-in x 50-ft Premium-Duty Rubber Hose while it sprays water" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/90nYOSU6x766CYNUSe1owGaVQr8=/fit-in/1500x3759/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/garden-hose-test-craftsman-premium-duty-rubber-red-dburreson-56-1-505662dba9394ee8a91e6bd320edda2b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-eley-58-inch-polyurethane-garden-hose></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Eley Polyurethane Garden Hose</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=800 data-sizes=750px alt="Eley 5/8-inch Polyurethane Garden Hose" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/7oqj1QB7waNlwBYFwar5uXgChcc=/fit-in/1500x800/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Eley58-inchPolyurethaneGardenHose-d5e2b43e68e84ab5bb1456919a53ea54.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Eley</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re seeking a heavy-duty hose that will hold up for many years of use, this hose is a good bet. It’s made with a thick polyurethane — a solid plastic that is strong with some flexibility, and a lead-free brass ring. It didn’t kink at all during our tests, so it should handle wear and tear with ease.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It wasn’t a hard hose to use apart from its short length. The water flow was good, and the actual hose was easy to grip. The short length (that pairs up with this excellent budget-friendly price) would best be used in small yards, possibly behind an apartment or patio home. Larger houses will absolutely need a longer hose, and this one is available with options up to 200 feet (with price increases accordingly).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How It’s Held Up</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Echoing our lab results, our team found this hose to work well at home, but only for the short distance that it covered. We ended up stopping testing early because the hose didn’t reach the majority of our yard, but the construction definitely held up despite outdoor use, and with a larger length, we think this hose could be a great value.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Length: </strong>6.5’<strong> | Material: </strong>Polyurethane<strong> | Type of Couplings: </strong>Lead-free brass fittings</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-flexible-flexzilla-garden-hose></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Flexible</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Flexzilla Garden Hose</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Flexzilla Garden Hose" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/uWCJLCWCjbZX0A4WThRUdXuFbGU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/flexzilla-zillagreen-garden-hose-69a3a7f618a344189e7c10e2994ef960.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>&nbsp;Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Size</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Grippy silicone handles make this hose easy to work with</p></li><li readability=0><p>Sturdy and easy to straighten out, without kinks</p></li><li readability=0><p>No leakage, and has a strong abrasion-resistant polymer construction</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>Heavy when full, making it a bit challenging to maneuver</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Bright yellow color may not appeal to everyone</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Scoring just a half point below our overall winner, the Flexzilla 50-ft Water Hose comes in a bright yellow color that’s easy to spot in the yard. It scored a 5 out of 5 in design for straightening out nicely and being as heavy as expected. We liked the squishy silicone handles on both ends. They provide a good grip and make it easy to attach the hose to a spigot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There was no leakage, but the hose was heavy when full, making it hard to swing over things while moving it around the yard. We gave it a score of 4.5 out of 5 for ease of use. The Flexilla closed out testing with a pair of 5 scores for durability and value. The hose was sturdy, with a great grip, and it did not kink at all. This is thanks to the unique abrasion-resistant polymer construction that allows for fantastic flexibility (hence the name) as well as no memory, so it constantly stays flat. We think it would hold up for a long time and noted that it’s got an affordable price point considering the quality.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Length: </strong>Up to 100’ | <strong>Material</strong>: Flexible hybrid polymer | <strong>Type of Couplings</strong>: Metal with O-ring</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-5 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Flexzilla Zillagreen Garden Hose coiled up on a wood deck" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/YyZt54OFPcB_Giy7ztoPakfuKOA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO_Flexzilla-50WaterHoseHFZG550YW_DB_022.jpg-c6d767b40cd04ac89fbbf00b85e047a6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=3643 data-sizes=750px alt="Person holding the Flexzilla Zillagreen Garden Hose in a grassy area during product testing" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3fZByZSjaEnHC1pneKPq2HWCt4o=/fit-in/1500x3643/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/garden-hose-test-flexzilla-50-water-hose-hfzg55oyw-rmarek-77-1-04e1dcf9c7354fe4a6c8e5147bd5eb6b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Rachel Marek</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-heavy-duty-briggs-and-stratton-50-foot-premium-heavy-duty-rubber-garden-hose></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Heavy Duty</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Briggs and Stratton Garden Hose</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1496 data-sizes=750px alt="black garden hose" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/7AC5-4GW5sSlFMvqYfH000zI3nk=/fit-in/1500x1496/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/91oMY8mdRWL._AC_SL1500_-a3d2476a0a5749a583f4af32db033f0e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Fit for commercial use with crush-proof metal couplings and industrial reinforcing</p></li><li readability=0><p>Not too heavy, even when filled with water</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Screwed into the nozzles and spigot easily</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This garden hose was very durable in our testing and had a decent length to be able to cover a lot of surface area. It's even fit for commercial use with its crush-proof metal couplings and industrial-style reinforcing to allow for heavy water flow. However, the black rubber material got very hot from sitting out in the sun, leading our testers to give it a score of 4 out of 5 for design.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In the remaining three categories, however (ease of use, durability, and value), the Briggs and Stratton hose scored a 5 out of 5. It was easy to carry and not too heavy when filled with water, and it screwed onto nozzles and spigots very easily. It held up well when dragged across surfaces, and the material felt like it would hold up to a lot of use. We think it's a great value for such a durable hose.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How It’s Held Up</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After one month of testing this hose at home, our teammate has used it regularly to water their garden with no complaints.

It coils without difficulty but also twists for flexible usage. The hose visibly expanded while the water was flowing, so you’re less likely to leave it on by accident. It was very lightweight to move around, but did get stuck on a rake in our testing; we also had to pull hard to get it around <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>outdoor furniture</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The pressure was released while the water was running, so you have to control the release somewhat. We also noticed the hose actually stretched more when the water was on. There’s also a water shut-off valve feature should you need to move between areas or switch nozzles without wanting to turn the water off completely at the source. Despite being lightweight, the double latex material is quite strong and seems durable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How It’s Held Up</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested this hose for up to six months and it soon became part of our teammate’s regular routine. The massive length allows you to move freely around your yard, and get plants even on the other side of your house. We loved the stopper at the end of the hose, so you can turn the water off so it doesn’t start flowing out as soon as you turn on the spigot. It’s super lightweight to move around (it didn't get caught like in our lab testing) and doesn’t kink at all. It coils well so storage hasn’t been an issue. We think this hose is one of the most versatile we tried — even allowing us to spray down <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>patio umbrellas</a> and furniture after pollen season.

With a length double those of most other hoses we tested, it still remained manageable to carry around. The zero-G hose was easy to connect, coil up, and uncoil to use. Maneuvering around buckets in our testing was a breeze, and the heavy-duty hardware impressed us. This is due to the coiled design, which helps keep the hose effortlessly serpentine and gliding through grass, dirt, and gravel without kinking. It's also puncture-resistant, so you can carry it with you through tough jobs without worrying about wearing away the material.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the zero-G hose was more expensive than some others with a list price of $75, we thought it was a good price for this hose. Yes, it’s more expensive, but it worked much better than others, and it was very long.

Unlike a traditional hose, these do not easily tangle or kink, and are easy to store since they bunch back up into place. We loved how sturdy this coil hose was during testing, and can confirm it’s easy to use. It’s not super long (shorter than most of the ones we tested), but it gets the job done and is lightweight to drag around.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The design was almost chic (a rare quality among garden hoses), and facilitates quick access and use (rather than having to slowly unreel a regular hose). The polyurethane material is thick and sturdy and should last for many years despite exposure to the elements. Considering the quality and performance of this hose, we think the price is very fitting.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How It’s Held Up</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Over the six months we tested this hose at home, it has held up well. It doesn’t extend as far as most other hoses we tested or snake around corners as neatly, but it works well. The manufacturer says that it’s 25 feet in length, but due to the tightness of the coils, it really only extends up to 20 feet. The tightness does facilitate easy storing, however, since it’s so compact. The materials are high quality and it doesn’t leak, so we think it will be durable for quite some time. Our only con is the length which would be more helpful if it was longer.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Length: </strong>25’<strong> | Material</strong>: Polyurethane | <strong>Type of Couplings: </strong>Lead-free brass</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-expandable-thefitlife-flexible-and-expandable-garden-hose></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Expandable</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>TheFitLife Garden Hose</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="TheFitLife Flexible and Expandable Garden Hose" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/hWu09QKtpvEsYviAMstsNZ__-V8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/thefitlife-flexible-and-expandable-garden-hose-cb206e8af82448ada6ed0c657f55a440.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Size</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Lightweight at just 4.5 pounds</p></li><li readability=0><p>Very durable — no fraying, even after being rubbed on top of rocks</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Stretches to 100 feet and returns to original length within seconds to stow easily</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At just 4.5 pounds, this fabric hose's core is made of a triple-layer latex wrapped with interwoven elasticated fabric, stretching to 100 feet from its original 33-foot length. Within seconds, it returns to its original length for you to coil and stow away easily. Of all the fabric hoses we tested, this one felt the most durable to our team with its high-quality materials. While some other expandable models would snag on rocks in testing, this one did not. Easy to coil and lightweight when empty, it’s got a shutoff switch attached to the solid brass fitting at the end of the hose, and it was easy to attach to a spigot.

This type of hose might be best for a vegetable garden with rows rather than flowers in various bushes, etc. However, it can easily connect to another hose if needed, and we appreciate the bright color and length.

First and foremost, the material you choose will determine your hose's lifespan. “For longer-lasting options, the rubber hoses with brass connections will hold up the best to the elements,” says Bateman. “Also look for a hose using reinforced mesh for strengthening if you want it to last longer. These qualities can make for the longest-lasting hose, but they may be heavier and harder to drain and connect, so you really want to think about the usage before you spend extra for features that might last longer but be harder to work with.” You'll also want to ensure that you're storing your hose safely, which brings us to our next point.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.98979591836735><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the best way to store a garden hose?</span></p><p>The type of storage you choose for your garden hose depends upon the type of hose you're working with; for example, a standard kink-free hose can be wound on a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hose reel</a>, while a fabric, metal, or soaker hose would fare better in a storage drum.

To that point, never leave a hose outside in cold weather, and be sure to store yours in a cool, dry place when the temperature dips.</p></li></ul><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Henry Wortock</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our team evaluated 30 garden hoses, rating them on their setup, design, ease of use, durability, and value.

For the soaker hose, specifically, we left the water running for two minutes while the hose sat on a concrete area to see exactly how much water was released. After our lab tests, we continued testing for up to six months to see how the hoses performed in the real world at real homes.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?<br></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rennie Dyball</a> is an experienced freelance writer who has covered hundreds of products in the home and lifestyle space.
