Email Harry Goodwin: harry.goodwin@the-sun.co.uk</strong></p><p>A 58-year-old female passenger, who does not want to be named, was on board with her husband and parents and said the ordeal was "horrendous".</p><p>Speaking of the incident when the ship turned to the side, she said: "You could hear plates crashing and then there was an announcement from the captain who screamed over the tannoy system as the ship veered.</p><p>"The panic in his voice made everyone else panic. People were told to sit down.</p><p>"The ship was all over the place. It was absolute pandemonium. Things were flying everywhere.</p><p>"People were being thrown all over the place. The medics were overrun.</p><p>"My mum saw someone being resuscitated, there were broken bones, people on stretchers and people crying including the crew, who were running around frantically trying to help everyone. It was petrifying.</p><p>"People were sleeping with life jackets on and writing messages home to loved ones in case we didn't get back. We're happy to be alive."</p><p>After arriving back at the port, the passenger said someone was airlifted off the ship while another left in a neck brace.</p><p>She said that reports on board suggested there were more than 100 people injured. She also praised the crew for their "great" efforts.</p><p>Peter Sawyer, 76, of Christchurch, Dorset, described the situation as "terrifying".</p><p>He said: "People were getting thrown out of their chairs. It was an absolute mess in the dining room and the cabins with furniture everywhere.</p><p>"We couldn't believe how high we were being thrown when the 54ft waves were hitting. People were being picked up off the floor.</p><p>"A lot of people were elderly and with mobility issues and were in single cabins.</p><p>"Many went downstairs so they were not on their own. The staff were brilliant in dealing with everything."</p><p>He also questioned the decision to head into the Bay of Biscay - with him saying a weather app had warned of 11.4 metre waves and strong gales a few days earlier.</p><p>He said: "We could have stayed in Gran Canaria a couple more days. Storms can be predicted. We should have made for shelter even if we were late back to port in Portsmouth."</p><p>Another passenger said they were put in a "dangerous situation" by heading for the UK when forecasts showed stormy weather.</p><p>"The ship was not moving for 18 hours so it took a battering from the waves and wind," she said.</p><p>"We were the only cruise ship in the Bay of Biscay. Others had taken refuge."</p><p>A letter from Saga Cruises CEO Nigel Blanks to customers said: "I appreciate it was an extremely frightening time but I wanted to reassure you that the ship remained safe."</p><p>He added that they would receive details about compensation in coming days following the "disappointing end to your cruise".</p><p>Saga Cruises said: "<a href=#>Spirit of Discovery</a> was sadly caught in the challenging weather conditions this weekend, as she started her return to the UK.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"The ship remained safe at all times, but due to the impact of the storm some guests sustained injuries.</p><p>"All were treated immediately by onboard medical staff. While the weather is clearly beyond our control, we want to offer our sincere apologies to all those affected who are now safely back, having sailed home in calmer seas."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4F3gZRtbmxno6W2s7XTZqafZZSewKS71Z6psmWTp8Kqv8RmqqGhoGKvosWMm6Csm5GufA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ariana-grande-takes-nap-studio-making-new-album-8420572.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ariana Grande Takes a Nap in Studio on Last Day of Making New Album">&larr;
