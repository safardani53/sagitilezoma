On July 17, 2012, <strong><a href=#>Kristen Stewart</a> </strong>was caught cheating on <strong><a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a> </strong>with her Snow White and the Huntsman director <strong>Rupert Sanders</strong>. (<a href=#>Us Weekly</a> broke news of the fling with exclusive photos of the shocking tryst, taken on July 17.) The scandal left the Twilight actress “devastated” for jeopardizing her relationship with her longtime boyfriend. Sanders, who has two young children with his wife, model <strong>Liberty Ross</strong> said in a statement he was “utterly distraught” for the pain he caused his family.</p><p>Now, one year later, both respective couples have ended their relationships. Here, Us offers a timeline of events that lead to the heartbreak and all that has happened since the scandal.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>August 2011</strong>: Stewart begins <a href=#>filming</a> Snow White and the Huntsman with Sanders in England and Wales. A source tells Us the actress was “early every day” for work.</p><p><strong>May 15, 2012</strong>: Stewart and the director enjoyed a <a href=#>group dinner</a> with Snow White castmembers at Monsieur Vuong Vietnamese restaurant in Berlin, Germany.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong>July 17, 2012:</strong> The 22-year-old actress met up with Sanders, 41, for a series of <a href=#>steamy makeout sessions</a> in Los Angeles, which was caught by photographers. The twosome spent the afternoon driving around L.A. in search of secluded places.</p><p><strong>July 19, 2012:</strong> Pattinson and Stewart seemed <a href=#>especially cozy</a> during a date at Hotel Cafe. During their outing in Los Angeles, “she leaned against him,” says a witness, who adds that the couple’s PDA was “cute.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>July 22, 2012:</strong> Stewart and Pattinson attended the <a href=#>2012 Teen Choice Awards</a> together in Universal City, Calif. The stars walked out on stage holding hands and gave their awards to their fans while thanking them for their years of support.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>July 23, 2012</strong>: Rumors began to circulate that Us was preparing to publish an explosive story that Stewart was caught cheating. Fans took to Twitter to express their disbelief and horror over the mere idea that Stewart could be unfaithful to Pattinson.

During his marathon makeout session with Stewart, “it seemed like they couldn’t get enough,” according to one photographer. Sanders’ wife <a href=#>tweeted</a> “Wow” just moments after Us called her husband’s rep for comment. She then later deactivated her Twitter account.</p><p><strong>July 25, 2012:</strong> In her most public proclamation of affection for her man, the actress <a href=#>released an anguished statement of apology</a>, saying, “I’m deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I’ve caused to those close to me and everyone this has affected. This momentary indiscretion has jeopardized the most important thing in my life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love him, I’m so sorry.” Sanders, issued his own <a href=#>statement</a>, shortly after Stewart. “I am utterly distraught about the pain I have caused my family,” the English director told Us. “My beautiful wife and heavenly children are all I have in this world. I love them with all my heart. I am praying that we can get through this together.”</p><p>Twipocalypse arrived as fans try to come to terms with the reality of the scandal after Stewart and Sanders confess. One Twi-hard posted a <a href=#>heartbreaking video</a> reaction to Stewart’s statement in which she cried on camera reading out loud. “If you loved him that much, you wouldn’t have done it,” she said between tears. “The thing is, you were stupid enough to be photographed doing it! Don’t be so stupid!”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=350 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Fan Crying" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>July 26:</strong> With Pattinson hiding out since the <a href=#>news broke</a>, a source close to the actor told Us he was “really depressed.
