S***. So, f*** off."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/racist3.png><p>The men repeatedly ask him to leave but he refuses, saying he wants to wait for the police.</p><p>When they ask him to "sit on the floor", he responds: "Why should I sit? No, I stand as a Christian."</p><p>He then ridicules their faith, saying he wants to "pray to Mohammed" and insists he can do what he likes in the mosque because it is an "open house".</p><p>As more worshippers arrive - including a small child - the man blasts: "S***. How many more can you f****** get in?"</p><p>He complains that "not one person has welcomed me" and says he will tell the police.</p><p>Another man replies: "Because you're Islamophobic. Why would we welcome you? Look at the state you're in. You're shouting, you're swearing, you hit people."</p><p>The man - wearing a black Armani T-shirt - replies: "See? People like this. You tell me you're all the same, lovely, lovely, lovely. You're liars."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in news</h2></p><p>The tense stand-off suddenly erupts when he slaps a man's hand away for filming him with a mobile phone.</p><p>He appears to grab the man by the wrist and raises his stick, shouting: "You little f***."</p><p>Before he can strike, he is pushed out through the open doorway, before he falls over backside-first onto the pavement.</p><p>He swings the extendable walking stick at them, bashing it against the door and raging: "F*** off, you f******."</p><p>As they surround him on the ground he appears to slap one of the men in the head before they wrestle the stick away from him.</p><p>He starts kicking out and shouts: "I'll kill that c***."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/racist4.png><p>One man tells him: "Just relax yourself, nobody wants to hurt you."</p><p>The thug then appears to "bite" him and says: "I'm gonna kill ya. It's about time you f****** realised we're not having this anymore. We don't want it, we're British."</p><p>The man replies: "So are we."</p><p>An alleged victim of the attack later wrote on Facebook: "This is a difficult time for us so we must remain vigilant."</p><p>A Met Police spokesman confirmed a man is currently being held on suspicion of racially aggravated assault.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rcist5.png><p>He said: "We were called to Roman Road at 4.10am yesterday to a report of a man behaving in a threatening way.</p><p>"Officers arrested a 57-year-old man on suspicion of racially aggravated actual bodily harm and he remains in custody. There were no reports of any serious injuries."</p><p><strong>We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?
