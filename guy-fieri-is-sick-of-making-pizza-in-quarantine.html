I was reaching out to all my friends that are chefs and saying, ‘Okay, <strong>Maneet Chauhan</strong>, send me some Indian dishes and let me prepare. Send me some stuff that I can work with the kids on.’ And there were crazy things that she sent us.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Guy’s Grocery Games star</a> added: “I’m on a nonstop quest to always try different foods and always try unique foods and continue to open up my portfolio of styles.”</p><p>When it comes to cooking in quarantine, Fieri, who has yet to have a quarantine <a href=#>kitchen disaster</a>, advises others not to be fearful of culinary mishaps, especially now. “Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. I don’t believe that every single time an artist writes a song that that song makes it to the top of the charts,” he told Us. “You have your good, your bad and you’re not so great, but we haven’t run into many of those recently.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Guy-Fieri-Jokes-He-Sick-Cooking-This-Food-Coronavirus-Quarantine-002.jpg><p>The Guy’s Big Bite alum also loves to make use of whatever ingredients he has on hand before they go bad, especially since supermarket runs are a bit more involved given the health crisis. “For instance, if you have mushrooms and you can’t use them as quickly as you need to, sauté them and then hold them in your fridge. Same thing with fresh spinach or any of your leafy greens. Buying what you can get when you can get it is the key and I’m a believer of making the recipe or making the dish or making what you’re having for dinner based upon what’s available and what’s fresh, especially starting with the vegetables. And then you just gotta adapt to it and overcome.”</p><p>Fieri, who developed a trio of recipes with Heluva Good!, recently took his own advice and even used one of the brand’s dips to upgrade a side dish. “We took some of the jalapeño cheddar dip and mixed it into leftover rice. We threw some vegetables into it,” he said. “You’ve got to become creative.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Starting on August 25, Fieri will be sharing his bold and delicious fully loaded creations featuring Heluva Good! Dip on his and Heluva Good!’s Instagram channels. Social media users can submit their own dishes for the chance to win a private virtual chat with the Guy’s Ranch Kitchen star, where he’ll share his very own recipe tips.
