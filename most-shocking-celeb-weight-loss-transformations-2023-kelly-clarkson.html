It’s not sexy or attractive."</p><p>A second person agreed, writing: "Rapid&nbsp;weight loss&nbsp;just makes one look sick. She’s pushing mid-40s before 30s."</p><p>Another commenter accused: "She does not look like she is into the hard work of any sort like going to a gym.

Not once."</p><p>Emily went on: "I am the strongest (mentally and physically) right now... at age 47... and I will continue to improve myself daily. My only competition is Me.</p><p>"Thank you for following this journey with me and for those of you who are always kind and comment positive things... I appreciate you!

We filmed this season a year ago."</p><p>While many followers noted the fact that Emily was rocking an "Ozempic body," the TV star has nothing to hide when it comes to the weight management medicine that has taken Hollywood by storm.</p><p>She stated that after filming wrapped, she had a doctor's appointment, where the idea of taking&nbsp;<a href=#>Ozempic</a>&nbsp;was put on the table.</p><p>“At that time I&nbsp;didn’t even know what Ozempic was&nbsp;honestly,” she told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>.</p><p>“The doctor was just like, ‘Oh,&nbsp;there’s this new weight loss drug and it’s just been FDA approved and it’s great.</p><p>"I think it would really help you lose some weight and you’ll feel better and you’ll be able to get working out again and feeling more like yourself.’ And I was like, ‘OK, sounds great.’</p><p>"Anyway, I did that in December. It was great for my diet. It really just kickstarted me into eating better and eating healthier ’cause it makes you feel like crap ’cause nothing tastes good.”</p><p>Emily also received liposuction and said she changed up her diet and exercise routine to further lose weight.</p><p>“I cut out a lot of things and I go to the gym seven days a week and work out. I work out like I’m training for a fitness competition. … That’s kind of the whole story,” she said.</p><p>“The thing that bothers me the most is that when people comment on the way that I look, they constantly say,&nbsp;‘Ozempic,&nbsp;Ozempic.’</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"And it’s like, yes, I did&nbsp;use that nine months ago&nbsp;or however many months ago it was, but I don’t like that it discounts all the hard work I put in.</p><p>"I don’t care if you say that all you want, but at least gimme credit for seven days a week, getting up at 6&nbsp;a.m. every morning and busting my butt in the gym every single day.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/em-gee-rhocs-emily-simpson-846303484.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/tamra-judge-vicki-gunvlason-exits-565114673.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaWaDenyTaKSoq6RiwKm7wqSgp59dmLKtscFmrp6hl53BbrjOrKpmrKKWu7SyzqukmqyZpLu0eZFpaWxlm5q5rcWMnKOaqpuovK97</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hairspray-live-casting-nbc-dream-cast-nick-jonas-rebel-wilson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nick Jonas, Rebel Wilson &amp;amp; More  Hollywood Life">&larr;
