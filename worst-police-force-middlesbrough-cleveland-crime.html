It's one of the busiest streets in the town and still people<br>felt like they could come straight in through the front window and<br>take whatever they wanted.</p><p>"Other times they came through the roof and on every occasion the<br>police weren't able to do anything.</p><p>"I can't get a single insurance company to cover me so I had to take<br>things into my own hands. I got the razor wire, which I roll out<br>every night from a cupboard I built at the end of the counter.</p><p>"Now they see it through the window and move on to the next place. They don't bother me, but I shouldn't have to do this.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE IN NEWS">READ MORE IN NEWS</h2><p>"If you walk down this entire street you won't find a business that<br>hasn't been robbed or burgled at some point. The whole place is<br>overtaken by criminals who want money for their next drugs fix.</p><p>"It's out of control and I worry that one day someone will come in<br>here with a gun or a knife and kill me and leave my young children<br>without a father. That's no joke."</p><p>This is Parliament Road, central <a href=#>Middlesbrough</a> - an area with one of<br>the UK's highest crime rates and this week revealed as the <a href=#>nation's most dangerous place to live for burglaries</a>.</p><p>Last year there were 7,100 recorded crimes in its small cluster of<br>terraced streets - that's 530 crimes for every 1,000 people.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>The chronically deprived neighbourhood comes under the jurisdiction of Cleveland Police, which now carries the <a href=#>unwanted tag of "Britain's worst force"</a> following a 2019 report that was the most scathing in the history of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary.</p><p>Tees Valley's elected Conservative mayor Ben Houchen believes the<br>force is so dysfunctional it should be disbanded.</p><p>At a public event in Middlesbrough last week, Mr Houchen said: "Everybody knows my views on Cleveland Police and they haven’t changed much in the last few years.</p><p>"I still think it’s a failed force, it’s the worst force in the country, it needs chucking in the bin and starting again.”</p><h2>'Thieves have no fear of the law'</h2><p>Salman Rasoul, 37, who has seen his pizza shop burgled four times in<br>the eight years he's owned it, wouldn't disagree.</p><p>He says: "The police come, they take fingerprints, they make notes and then in a short while they'll be in touch to say the case has been<br>closed, unsolved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000736081019.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000737168570.jpg><p>"We need more officers on the streets to make these people think twice before they rob you. It's happening here every day.</p><p>"They've come in through the windows and removed slates to let<br>themselves in through the roof. They have no fear of the law."</p><p>Hurrying along the road, Ian Hill, 35, is an hour late for his<br>appointment at the housing office. The can of super-strength cider in his hand might be a clue as to why. It's 11am.</p><p>"I just want to get out of this place, it's completely<br>mental," Ian says. "I want to get away and live somewhere else - anywhere will do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000736081081.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000736081000.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000736080922.jpg><p>"I've got people kicking in my door at 2am and 5am, all times of day<br>and night. They've taken everything I have: my telly, my clothes, the<br>lot.</p><p>"The place is rattling with crack cocaine, it's got really bad over<br>the last couple of years, crack has taken over and the users are<br>causing mayhem.</p><p>"I can't cope any more. I'm going to the housing office to beg them to put me somewhere else."</p><p>His friend Leonie Prince, 33, says: "It's getting worse around here<br>and that's saying something. Girls are openly selling themselves on<br>the streets for crack.</p><p>"Down on Union Street when it starts to get dark they all come out. You can see them every night and it's because they're addicted, that's<br>why there's so much crime here."</p><h2>Worrying spike in sexual violence</h2><p>One of the most worrying trends is a spike in violent and sexual crime<br>with almost 12,000 such offences committed across Middlesbrough last year.</p><p>Gemma Willis, 37, survived a horrific ordeal of sexual violence from<br>her former partner in another part of the Cleveland force area. He was later jailed for 13 years and she now campaigns to help other victims.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000736080939.jpg><p>She said: "The number of sexual crimes being committed, especially in Middlesbrough, is terrifying.</p><p>"For every one of those reported, there will be many more that aren't<br>because it takes so much courage to come forward and report it.</p><p>"Every one of those girls will have to live with what's happened to<br>them for the rest of their lives. I still cannot trust a man in a relationship and sometimes scrub my skin raw because I don't feel<br>clean.</p><p>"It's about the community and not just the police, people need to step in and report it if they have suspicions. I was beaten and sexually<br>assaulted in my front garden and people saw what happened but no one intervened.</p><p>"I have no criticism of Cleveland Police, the officer in my case was<br>incredible. But more needs to be done to protect women on Teesside, these figures aren't acceptable."</p><h2>Proud community spirit</h2><p>Everyone we meet is in agreement that grinding poverty and drug<br>addiction fuel the spiralling crime rate, but there is nonetheless a proud, caring community spirit.</p><p>Susan Gill, 63, runs the Homeless Cafe in Princes Road, central Middlesbrough.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000736081009.jpg><p>On the back wall she has pinned a photographic tribute to every one of the cafe's users who have died over the past three years. There are 33 pictures.</p><p>"We need to update it, there have been another four this year," she says grimly. "All four died within a couple of weeks of each other. There was a bad batch of pills on the streets and it took all their lives.</p><p>"I often have to arrange their funerals because no one can find their<br>family members. It's heart-breaking.</p><p>"Lately we've had quite a few amputees as well. It's fairly common for<br>intravenous drug users to get terrible infections from injecting their<br>legs and groins to find veins that haven't collapsed.</p><p>"In a lot of cases their wounds are so bad they're actually asking to<br>have their legs removed.</p><p>"We have around 700 people referred to us by the police and council<br>and that's a lot to cope with for a team of volunteers.</p><p>"Of course having so many people in desperate need causes a spike in<br>the crime rate, but it's often petty crime like shoplifting.</p><p>"Anyone who hasn't eaten in days and has no clean underwear and no<br>income will consider stealing. They're doing it out of desperation, to<br>preserve their dignity."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000736080987.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000736081051.jpg><p>Evidence of the poverty in this part of Middlesbrough is everywhere.</p><p>Earlier in the day, at 8.30am, a line of people begin queuing along<br>the pavement outside St Oswald's Church, Grove Hill, to get the best<br>picks from its food bank.</p><p>The deacon, Rev Kath Dean, says: "It's the same every week, people<br>like to come on the first morning we're open just in case we run out<br>of food.</p><p>"It's a terrible, desperate situation and it's been made worse by the<br>pandemic and the cost of living crisis.</p><p>"Of course this kind of desperate situation causes crime. We see a lot<br>of cars broken into, people just hoping to find something of value<br>inside."</p><h2>Force's history of shame and scandal</h2><p>Cleveland Police is a force with unprecedented problems. Mark Webster has just become its seventh chief constable in under 10 years following a string of scandals.</p><p>One former chief - Mike Veale - is facing a gross misconduct hearing<br>accused of breaching professional standards during his short stint in<br>charge.</p><p>At a misconduct hearing for another senior officer an allegation<br>emerged that Veale had been involved in a secret relationship with<br>Christiana Emsley, the force's civilian head of standards and ethics.</p><p>The 2019 HMI report found the force to be failing in all key areas,<br>but it has vowed to win back the public's trust.</p><p>Acting Inspector Steven Pattison, from Middlesbrough Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: “We have dedicated officers working in central Middlesbrough, including one of our PCSOs who received a British Empire Medal (BEM) for her services to policing and the local community in the Gresham ward and was nominated by more than 240 local people who know her by name.</p><p>“Today we carried out two warrants in central Middlesbrough and we<br>continue to gather intelligence and respond to local peoples’<br>concerns.</p><p>“We work closely with partners including Middlesbrough Council and<br>housing providers. We recently secured a closure order on a property<br>in this area, by working with key partners to provide intelligence on<br>antisocial behaviour linked to an address. The order means it’s an<br>offence for anyone to return to that address.</p><p>“We’d encourage anyone concerned about crime where they live or walk to report it to us so we can build evidence and take action. Call 101 and ask for Middlesbrough Neighbourhood Policing Team.”</p><p>Chief Constable Mark Webster said: “I’m aware of the comments made by Ben Houchen. After only a few weeks as Cleveland’s Chief Constable I have been deeply impressed by the hundreds of people who I have met so far.</p><p>"Teams are working incredibly hard in difficult circumstances and it’s<br>important that we work together as senior leaders to support the<br>frontline policing response.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>“I have set a clear direction for Cleveland Police to tackle crime and protect communities and I share a vision to see Teesside succeed.</p><p>"I look forward to discussing this with Mr Houchen when I get to meet him for the first time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000736080642-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoV4fpZyZ2xnp6S%2FtMCMqaaloZOaeqe70ZycZqWZmbGtsdKbqaitl516pLjEr5ylmZ6ZeqS%2ByKacaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lauren-burnham-hospitalized-for-postpartum-health-complications.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="It's &amp;quot;Getting Worse,&amp;quot; Husband Says">&larr;
