especially with his resurfaced family member.</p><h2>BACK TOGETHER AGAIN</h2><p>Last week, the SUR DJ took to Instagram&nbsp;to make an announcement regarding his beloved&nbsp;<a href=#>pup</a>.</p><p>James shared two new photos with Graham, the dog he bought with his ex&nbsp;<a href=#>Raquel Leviss</a>&nbsp;years ago when they were still a couple.</p><p>Amid their split in December 2021, Raquel, 28, took custody of the shared pup.</p><p>James and Raquel were broken up during the most recent season of VPR, however, James was seen meeting up with his ex at a public park so James could spend time with the dog he helped raise.</p><p>Things have now taken a turn, however, as Raquel has been spending the past few months in a mental health facility amid the&nbsp;<a href=#>Scandoval</a>&nbsp;fallout.</p><p>After it was discovered that Raquel had been having a months-long affair with her friend and co-star&nbsp;<a href=#>Tom Sandoval</a>, 40, Raquel immediately went off the grid following the season 10 reunion filming.</p><p>Although Raquel has recently left the facility, after being unable to care for the dog for so long, James announced that he will be Graham's caretaker from now on.</p><p>It <a href=#>was also revealed </a>that Raquel had dropped Graham off at a shelter due to behavioral issues that included biting.</p><p>After he arrived at the shelter,&nbsp;<a href=#>Lisa Vanderpump</a>'s organization, the Vanderpump Dog Foundation, worked out a way for Graham and James to be reunited.</p><p>Sources told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> that the musician got the dog in training classes and has seen improvement.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Additionally, James is reportedly happy to have his pooch back in his possession and has renamed him to Hippie as an ode to his godfather.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/summer-days-vanderpump-rules-james-834252856.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/james-escape-vanderpump-rules-james-826591369.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/dog-graham-raquel-owned-seems-833007165-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZm5%2BeoCVaK2appSav7HBzKlkq62cmsButsCmnKxlm5q7r7HDsmSsoJ%2BswG6uwJyispmimXqvsdZmraKclaR8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-jeremie-villet-photographer-wiki-family-and-net-worth-details.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Jrmie Villet?
