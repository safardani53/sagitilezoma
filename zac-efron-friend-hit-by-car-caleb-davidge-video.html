Not only did he survive the astonishing accident, there’s video evidence of the moment of impact. News of the terrifying incident broke on Jan. 22, a day after Zac, 31, penned an emotional tribute to his friend on Instagram. Next to a photo of him with his pal, the actor wrote, “14 weeks ago my friend&nbsp;@calebdavidge&nbsp;was hit by a car. It was gnarly. I’m incredibly thankful he’s alive and so impressed by his positivity throughout this process. You inspire me brother. Can’t wait to surf again with you soon.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>But Zac’s sweet tribute didn’t fully convey the intensity of the incident, which Caleb himself shared on Instagram by posting a clip on his own page, two days earlier. The footage –&nbsp;captured by a restaurant’s security camera –&nbsp;is so hard to watch that Instagram blurred the preview and issued a warning that “some people may find” the video “offensive or disturbing.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In the clip Caleb tries to get into his Uber from the rear passenger door when a car smashes into him, rips the door off its hinges and drags him several yards along the road. The smash took place on trendy Abbott Kinney Boulevard in Venice and several eyewitnesses can be seen racing down the street to rush to his aid. Somehow Caleb survived but not without breaking every rib in his body. His injuries are intense. He captioned the video by writing, “It’s been 14 weeks today since I was hit at 60mph while getting into my Uber, and not a minute has passed where I haven’t thought about how fortunate I am. Every day has been a challenge for me physically but my mind and spirit have grown in ways I never imagined. Man… all the s*** I took for granted! Looking back at all the little things I was stressing about just makes me laugh now.”</p><a href=# rel=nofollow readability=1><p>View this post on Instagram</p></a><p><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>It’s been 14 weeks today since I was hit at 60mph while getting into my Uber, and not a minute has passed where I haven’t thought about how fortunate I am. Every day has been a challenge for me physically but my mind and spirit have grown in ways I never imagined. Man..all the shit I took for granted! Looking back at all the little things I was stressing about just makes me laugh now. I broke all of my ribs on both sides. My right ribs shattered and punctured my lungs, which both collapsed and were bleeding out. My right arm was poking out of my sweatshirt. My left femur went thru my knee joint and fractured my tibia, and tore my left MCL. An ice cream scoop sized chunk came out of my left leg. My right knee has a torn ACL, MCL, and meniscus. I lacerated my liver and my spleen, and broke four bones in my spine. Just want to say thanks to all my friends and family that have been by my side through it all, you know who you are and I feel so lucky to have you in my life. The doctors at UCLA that kept me positive. And the random strangers that keep offering to help me on crutches is something I never expected. I cannot wait to walk again, hopefully even surf again, one day soon. If you’re still reading this tell someone you care about how much they mean to you, you might not get the chance tomorrow!🕺🏼🙏🏼</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Caleb Davidge</a> (@calebdavidge) on Jan 18, 2019 at 2:06pm PST</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Caleb added, “I broke all of my ribs on both sides.
