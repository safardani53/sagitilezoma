I'll be thinking of you together with our sons forever, Love, Colin."</p><p>In another note on a wreath laid for his dead children he wrote: "We'll be together again soon Mummy, D and N."</p><p>At the time of the funeral it was believed that Sheila had been the one who killed everyone in the house due to her history of poor mental health.</p><p>But the blame soon shifted to her adopted brother, <a href=#>Jeremy</a> who was eventually <a href=#>convicted of the murders of Sheila, Nevill, June and the twins.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000001042435.jpg><h2>What happened to Colin Caffell after the White House Farm murders?</h2><p>Before <a href=#>Jeremy Bamber</a> was <a href=#>convicted of their murders</a>, it was speculated that Sheila could have killed her family, but this was later disputed.</p><p>Colin also defended Sheila by insisting that she wouldn't have harmed her children regardless of her mental state.</p><p>He began writing a book about what happened and included details of the lives of the Bamber family.</p><p>Following the book's publication, Colin began a psychotherapy workshop called Life, Death And Transition in which he worked with people convicted of murder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000548189216-e1580936051241.jpg><h2>Where is Colin Caffell now?</h2><p>The <a href=#>White House Farm murders</a> are now the subject of an ITV drama titled White House Farm, based in part on the book Colin wrote in the 1990s.</p><p><a href=#>Colin chosen to collaborate with the TV adaptation</a> of the story in a bid to tell the world the truth and gain complete closure.</p><p>He said: “Over the years, I’ve been approached by many people about doing something about it, and generally it just didn’t feel right.</p><p>"But the creators made it clear that they wanted to tell the story properly and actually get to the psychological underbelly of the story.</p><p>“I had a choice — to be completely consumed by it or to get above it. If I’d just given in and then been the victim of all that, it would have been a sense of defeat to Jeremy. I wasn’t going to let him beat me.</p><p>"Now 35 years down the line I felt very much that I’ve reached a point of resolution and healing.”</p><p>He eventually remarried and currently lives with his wife in Cornwall after closing down his psychotherapy practice.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">LATEST ON WHITE HOUSE FARM</h2></p><p>In the last 15 to 20 years, he turned professional artist, specialising in creating sculptures and pottery.</p><p>Caffell recently returned to the public eye when he appeared on This Morning&nbsp;in January.</p><p>During his interview, he recalled the moment he began suspecting his former brother-in-law, Jeremy Bamber, was guilty of the murders.</p><p>He said: "I welcomed Jeremy into my flat, supported him, and gave him all of the brotherly love that I could as a victim. But then he started to show elements of him not really grieving.</p><p>"Once June and Neville and Sheila's funeral happened, we were in the car going to the crematorium and he started larking around with Julie in the front of the car, saying what he would like to be doing to her later in the afternoon, really sick, really sick [things]."</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>White House Farm sees Jeremy Bamber romp with an older woman on holiday</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZn16fJFrbm9nk6S5qrqMnJifnpWhuW6%2Fx56gpZmjYrK5eceuqpuZnpl6tcPIp2Ssp56oeqy1y6WcnWWnnba1sYyhpq6rlWKzor7MZq6hnaKaeq%2B71mg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./american-gigolo-was-canceled-on-showtime-after-its-first-season.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="American Gigolo Was Canceled On Showtime After Its First Season">&larr;
