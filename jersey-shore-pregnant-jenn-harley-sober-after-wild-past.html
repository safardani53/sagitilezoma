But I feel good," <a href=#>Jenn</a> told The U.S. Sun exclusively.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Jersey Shore">Read More on Jersey Shore</h2><p>"I mean, after a while you just don't think about it. And, you know, it just doesn't even sound appetizing or anything to you."</p><h2>A NEW CHAPTER</h2><p>MTV fans might recall many of Jenn's biggest fights that were publicized stemmed from her drinking.</p><p>In June 2021, she was <a href=#>arrested for domestic violence</a> in Las Vegas following an explosive altercation with Joe, 35.</p><p>The police report, obtained by The U.S. Sun at the time, noted the couple's conversation was about Jenn's drinking.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Shortly after, she checked into a <a href=#>Las Vegas</a> rehab facility to seek treatment for her alcohol dependency.</p><p>Jenn and Joe had split for a couple of months that summer before getting back together.</p><p>The <a href=#>Jersey Shore</a> alum explained how being sober helps with their on-again, off-again relationship.</p><p>"Well us being sober helps a lot. Like not drinking, not going out, not being in the party scene," she reasoned.</p><p>"That had a huge damper on our relationship and especially with my past relationships as well.</p><p>"When both of you guys are drinking and partying, it just causes chaos in your relationship, and without any of that, everything's like calm and normal and how it should be."</p><p>Fans also witnessed Jenn and ex <a href=#>Ronnie Ortiz-Magro</a> getting into explosive fights on Jersey Shore prior to the Bronx native <a href=#>taking a break from filming</a>.</p><p>The former couple has had&nbsp;<a href=#>multiple domestic violence arrests</a>&nbsp;and rehab attempts in the past several years. &nbsp;</p><h2>MOVING FORWARD</h2><p>Despite fans being convinced that Joe and Jenn secretly got engaged, Jenn says they're not engaged as they currently don't have plans to get married anytime soon.</p><p>The mom of two clarified where she and Joe stand now:</p><p>"It was like a little rocky... with everything that was going on between Ronnie and I, and <a href=#>the custody stuff</a> and going back and forth from California.</p><p>"So, I mean, there was some <a href=#>off and on patches</a>. It was hard to work through, but ever since then we worked through it and made it happen."</p><p>She then spilled: "We have no plans on getting married as of right now. I haven't been like a believer in marriage, really.</p><p>"But I think down the road, that's probably something Joe would wanna do... If I did [get married], it would be barefoot on the beach, like destination somewhere."</p><h2>SETTLING DOWN</h2><p>While awaiting the birth of baby "J," whose gender and full name she is waiting to announce, Jenn is focusing on her other two kids - daughter Ariana Sky, 5, and son Mason, 17.</p><p>She's also in the process of <a href=#>settling into her Miami home</a> after moving from Vegas - a move that she says has been for the better when it comes to co-parenting.</p><p>"[Ronnie] was like, 'Hey, I'm thinking about moving to Florida, would you be interested in going?'</p><p>"And I was like, 'Hell yes! I'm in like, let's go,'" Jenn explained, mentioning how "it was a lot" to commute back and forth from Nevada to California each week to share 50/50 custody.</p><p>She now says co-parking is "definitely" much easier and everything is going well between her and the reality star.</p><p>Jenn told The U.S. Sun: "We definitely are on the same page with everything with Ariana, like her schooling. It's been super easy. There hasn't been any drama. We're able to communicate. So it's been a lot better."</p><p>The 5-year-old little girl, in fact, was the one who <a href=#>"spilled the beans"</a> to her father about her mom's pregnancy.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>When asked if there are any lingering legal issues between her and her ex, Jenn stated: "No, we agreed we are done with court. We're adults, we can work it out together."</p><p>While Jenn has no plans on making an appearance on Jersey Shore, she did tease that she could be participating in a real estate-based reality show that is "possibly" in the works.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/adam-opris-photography-pictures-supplied-836834324-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/jenn-harley-joe-ambr-daughter-836983490.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/ronnie-ortiz-magro-jen-harley-528112297.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwaGWBeIOSaKGeqqOaxm6%2Fx6ipnmWgp7KousCnq2ailaO7brTAq6OesV2ovKOx0WaYn6yVp3q4tcudZKmZo6l8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./park-bo-gums-girlfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Park Bo-gums Girlfriend: Who is Park Bo-gum Dating?">&larr;
