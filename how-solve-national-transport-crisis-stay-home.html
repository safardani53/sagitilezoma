Getting there took more than an hour.</p><p>So I was late for that, too.</p><p>The following day I had to go to <a href=#>Old Trafford</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE TRANSPORT NEWS">READ MORE TRANSPORT NEWS</h2><p>And to get there on time, I had to miss the <a href=#>Manchester</a> rush hour, which meant using single-track roads round Altrincham that had grass growing out of them.</p><p>On Thursday I was due back in London, but thanks to those A40 roadworks, I thought I’d use the train.</p><p>But when I arrived at my local station, I realised straight away that something was wrong.</p><p>Because the car park was empty.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Yup, the <a href=#>train drivers were on strike.</a></p><p>A fact mentioned only in an obscure sub-menu on GWR’s website.</p><p>I therefore had to get a taxi to a station in <a href=#>Oxford</a>, where I boarded something from the 19th century.</p><p>It had no legroom, stopped at villages that haven’t been on a map since the time of Edward the Confessor and, bit by bit, picked up everyone in South East England.</p><p>It was so crowded that to prevent suffocation, the lady next to me suggested we synchronise our breathing.</p><p>And then in London, the <a href=#>Elizabeth rail line</a> wasn’t working and there were problems too on the Central Line.</p><p>And that night, some people were stuck underground for three hours because a wiring board shorted out and Paddington station was closed, which meant you couldn’t get to <a href=#>Heathrow</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tectonic plates</h2><p>Not that you’d want to go to Heathrow, because these days you have to stand around for hours waiting to be examined internally by a security officer who isn’t there, because he’s working from home, and then, when you do get to your gate, you find the flight has been cancelled.</p><p>Things can’t be this bad by accident.</p><p>No one’s that useless.</p><p>So someone must be doing it on purpose.</p><p>And I reckon they are.</p><p><a href=#>You pay half your yearly salary to drive into London</a> and what do you get in return?</p><p>Traffic lights that are green for such a short period of time, you need a Bugatti Veyron to capitalise on the moment, cycle lanes that no one uses when it’s raining and a “road closed” sign on every corner.</p><p>And when something goes wrong, there’s no sense of urgency to mend it.</p><p>Hammersmith Bridge, for example.</p><p>That’s going to be shut... for ever.</p><p>Elsewhere, the motorways are patrolled by Highway Officers who are told that when there’s an incident, the No1 priority is to look after themselves.</p><p>No it isn’t.</p><p>The No1 priority is to get the bloody road open as quickly as possible.</p><p>Time and again, I divert off a shut-down motorway and fumble along lanes so narrow the door mirrors are snapping branches in the hedges.</p><p>And why?</p><p>Because instead of removing the problem that caused the motorway to be shut, the Highway Officer is sitting in his 4x4 having a sandwich.</p><p>The Tubes?</p><p>Forget it.</p><p>If a train comes at all, it’ll crawl along so slowly that if the tectonic plates are moving in the opposite direction, you won’t move at all.</p><p>And I can’t even remember a time when the train drivers were at work.</p><p>I know their <a href=#>trade union leaders</a> are bonkers but surely to God, they could have had some sense larched into them by now.</p><p>Unless of course, no one wants the trains to be back on song and no one wants the roads to be clear.</p><p>And no one wants airports to be full of happy families whizzing through without a hassle.</p><p>Maybe, someone has worked out that the only way of <a href=#>achieving net zero</a> is to make travel so unbearable that we all choose to stay at home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/view-train-station-railway-workers-837030724.jpg><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Rash bash trash</h2><p>WHEN inmates at a category C prison in Staffordshire decided to paint a mural of <a href=#>Marcus Rashford</a>, you might imagine all would be well.</p><p>But no.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/marcus-rashford-england-celebrates-scoring-779283409.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/hmp-stafford-prison-214036923.jpg><p>One of the prison guards objected and sued her bosses for religious discrimination.</p><p>Is Rashford a racist? It seems unlikely.</p><p>He’s a fine footballer and, thanks to his tireless work helping to feed vulnerable children, he’s widely regarded as something of a working-class hero.</p><p>So what’s the problem?</p><p>Well, it turns out that Rashford was once photographed with a rapper called Wiley, who is apparently anti-Semitic.</p><p>And it was this picture that upset the guard.</p><p>That’s madness.</p><p>The late <a href=#>Queen</a> was once photographed with Rolf Harris.</p><p>That didn’t make her a cartoonist.</p><p>Mercifully, a judge threw the case out.</p><p>Rightfully so.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Global warming appears a damp squib</h2><p>THINK it’s been a <a href=#>bit wet lately</a>?</p><p>You’re right.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-pedestrians-umbrellas-westminster-bridge-859562425.jpg><p>Being a bit of a bore, I monitor rainfall these days and 2023 is well on its way to being a record- breaker.</p><p>And to think they promised us <a href=#>global warming.</a></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">I hear less'o Lisa</h2><p>FOR 15 years, I’ve struggled to hear what people are saying.</p><p>Which is especially embarrassing when I’m hosting <a href=#>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a> and the contestant is a bit of a mumbler.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/cf9byd-hearing-aid-isolated-white-864962729.jpg><p>It’s also annoying when I can’t hear what someone’s saying, and they get cross.</p><p>Why? If a blind person momentarily inconveniences you by taking a little longer than usual to cross the road, you don’t lean out of the window and tell him to get an effing move on.</p><p>Whatever, I now have hearing aids and I must say that they’re pretty brilliant.</p><p>I can understand what <a href=#>Joaquim Phoenix </a>says.</p><p>I can hear birds singing.</p><p>And I can change the settings via an app so that they drown out background noise in a pub.</p><p>I can even use them via Bluetooth to have phone conversations.</p><p>But the best thing is that I can filter out the Irish accent so that when my Dubliner girlfriend Lisa asks me to put the bins out, I hear nothing at all.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Why a cow is green</h2><p>LAST week, <a href=#>Channel 4</a> transmitted a programme in which the host basically said that if you eat beef something or other terrible will happen.</p><p>I have no problem with that. I may not have agreed with his views, but he’s perfectly entitled to express them.</p><p>And because this was Channel 4, no one was listening anyway.</p><p>What I do object to, however, is his workings out.</p><p>They were wrong.</p><p>Sure, if you eat meat from a cow that’s been force-fed with chemicals and reared in a factory in <a href=#>Texas</a>, it’s probably not great for the environ- ment.</p><p>But British cows stand around all day turning the grass they eat into natural, fully organic fertiliser.</p><p>We need big animals like that to keep the soil healthy.</p><p>So eating beef is actually good for the <a href=#>environment</a>.</p><p>Bear that in mind when you sit down tomorrow for your roast.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Or you stop off tonight for a restorative <a href=#>Maccy D.</a></p><p>You’re being a better <a href=#>Greta</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4F6hZNvcHJnmKTEbr%2FOpa2eZZ6Wwaq7zZqjZqyilru0vM6rq2abop7Aqr%2BMrKuasV2dvK6xjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./stevie-ray-vaughan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stevie Ray Vaughan">&larr;
