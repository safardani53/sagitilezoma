Parrish was coming in hot at Eichen House. Theo wasn’t messing around, though. Theo grabbed Lydia by the throat in front of Parrish. Tracy and the rest of Theo’s pack tried to go after Parrish, but nothing worked. Corey even became a piece of burnt toast trying to attack Parrish.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Stiles watched all of this go down. Valack injured Theo to get Lydia, and somehow managed to get away in front of all of these supernatural creatures. Then Theo threw a pipe right threw Parrish’s heart. Ouch.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Valack now had Lydia (again), and Stiles was FREAKING out. He tried busting down the door to get to his OTP. Theo showed up and kicked the door in like a total third wheel. But as much Stiles didn’t want it to be so, he needed Theo’s help. “You’re not going to find her without me,” Theo said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Meanwhile, Kira was&nbsp;thisclose to losing control. Malia refused to leave her. Later, Donovan turned up in the morgue and said he could help Kira. But he would only help if Malia helped Corey. So the pair worked together to save their friends.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Against All Odds</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>Scott and Liam needed to find an alternative to get to Lydia and fast. So they went to Meredith. Sorry, but I legit thought she was dead. Scott&nbsp;pleaded with her to help. Using Meredith, Scott was able to get closer to Lydia and realized what he needed to do to find her. He saw her losing her damn mind. It wasn’t pretty. Meredith admitted that she didn’t have much time. Lydia&nbsp;was getting consumed by her power. Lydia would be able to find out who the Beast was, but it would kill her. The only person who could save her was Parrish.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Elsewhere in Eichen House, Theo had Lydia’s scent. Stiles was super skeptical as to why Theo wanted Lydia. However, the two actually made a decent team. They were led to the tunnels, becoming so much closer to finding Lydia than anyone else.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Scott and Liam found Parrish first. Of course, he remembered nothing. As the Hellhound, Parrish&nbsp;was able to get through the mountain ash. Once he walked through, Scott and Liam were able to pass as well.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>As Theo and Stiles were roaming the tunnels, Theo tried to justify killing his sister. Dude, just no. Stiles still didn’t trust Theo whatsoever, but Theo said he was probably going to be the one who kept everyone alive. Yes, he wanted the Beast’s power, but he wanted to kill the Beast.</p><h3>‘You Came Back’</h3><p id=content-paragraph-12>Valack had Lydia and basically wanted to kill her for answers. This poor girl. He even wanted to put that AWFUL mask on her head. This dude really wanted to know who the Beast was. Apparently, the monster wasn’t fully grown. This teenager was the last genetic chimera, and it could be a man or woman. Lydia was sure she didn’t know of any more chimeras. Valack said the mask would help her find the identity of the Beast. Well, Theo and Stiles showed up at the door, but Lydia didn’t need them.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Her scream nearly blew Valack’s head off. Goodbye, Valack. You won’t be missed. As soon as she was done, Stiles ran in to get Lydia. His face was pure relief. “You came back,” Lydia muttered to Stiles. Of course he came back! Regardless of what’s happened, Stiles has always loved Lydia. End of story. This was such an epic Stydia moment. Lydia begged Stiles to walk away before she hurt him. Stiles&nbsp;snapped, “Please shut up and let me save your life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>This magical moment ended, and Lydia’s screaming wasn’t finished. Fortunately for everyone and their eardrums, Parrish showed up to muffle her scream with his flames. He walked out carrying her.&nbsp;It was now time to get the hell out of Eichen House.</p><h3>‘He Saved Me’</h3><p class=p1>Before they could all climb into Stiles’ jeep, Tracy grabbed Lydia. Thankfully, Mrs. Martin stepped up and took her down. FINALLY. As Scott raced to the clinic, Lydia was leaning on Stiles in the backseat. I can’t even deal. Stiles tried to keep her calm, but she kept screaming. Stiles didn’t even care that his ear started bleeding. He only cared about Lydia.</p><p class=p1>Stiles was the one to lift her up onto the table when they got to the clinic. Such a gentleman. Lydia then screamed so loud that the windows shattered. Stiles covered her body so she wouldn’t get hit by the glass. Meanwhile, Scott was on the floor. When Stiles lifted himself up, Lydia wasn’t waking up. She wasn’t moving. It was like she was dead. Stiles pleaded with her to open her eyes. The look on his face was pure panic and devastation.</p><p class=p1>Suddenly, she woke up. He cradled her face in his hands. They grabbed each other’s hands for comfort. Meanwhile, I’m crying my eyes out. Mrs. Martin witnessed all of this. When she hugged her daughter, Lydia said, “He saved my life, Mom. Stiles saved me.”</p><p class=p1>Okay, so if you didn’t already know, I’m a Stydia shipper. Tonight’s episode was the moment we witnessed things change between Stiles and Lydia. Stiles has always looked at Lydia this way, but Lydia finally saw Stiles for who he truly is: her hero.</p><h3 class=p1>Elsewhere in Beacon Hills</h3><p class=p1>*Liam and Hayden got it on in this ep.&nbsp;It was dubbed “#PuppyStyle” on Twitter. It was pretty darn racy. I’m just super surprised that we got a Liam and Hayden sex scene before a Stydia one.</p><p class=p1>*Hayden watched over Deucalion while the chimera gang was at Eichen House. I really didn’t care for anything that happened between them. Tonight was all about Stydia. Bye!</p><p class=p1><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what did you think of tonight’s Teen Wolf?
