Ibrahim Abdul Matin was a well-known novelist well recognized for his breakthrough work “Green Deen.” Mr. Matin was an environmental justice strategist and activist in addition to being an author. Ibrahim Abdul was also a former director of community relations for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, a founding partner of Green Squash Consulting, and a visiting professor at Baruch College in New York City.</p><p>He is well-known and respected for his contributions to environmental sustainability. People who knew him were taken aback by his untimely death.&nbsp;The reason of death for the well-known novelist has not been revealed. Many concerns remain regarding the late environmental justice strategist and activist’s personal life. After discussing his work life, let’s take a closer look at his personal life.</p><h2>Ibrahim Abdul Matin’s Religion</h2><p><strong>Ibrahim Abdul Matin</strong> was a fervent Muslim, i.e., the author of Green Deen was a Muslim. He was quite proud of his beliefs. He was also a Muslim environmentalist who studied the links between Islamic teachings and ecology in his book “Green Deen: What Islam Teaches about Protecting the Planet.”&nbsp;According to the Amazon book description, Muslims are bound by their religion to worship the Creator and watch out for one another.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ibrahim-Abdul-Matin-1.jpg alt="Ibrahim Abdul Matin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Environmental action and Islamic values have a long history, according to the author. Ibrahim Abdul-Matin’s groundbreaking work examined Islam’s emphasis on humanity’s common obligation as Earth stewards via research, scripture, and interactions with Muslim Americans.&nbsp;Abdul-Matin explained the title by saying “Deen” means “path or way” in Arabic.&nbsp;The late author presented several instances of how Muslims should and do practice Green Deen in four areas: “waste, watts (energy), water, and food.”&nbsp;People of all faiths, according to Mr. Matin, can acknowledge and respect Islam and Muslims’ contributions to the environmental movement. He also urged people all across the globe to follow Green Deen (Green Path).</p><h2>Ibrahim Abdul Matin Had Three Children: Meet His Wife And Children</h2><p><strong>Ibrahim Abdul Matin</strong> was a married guy with a couple of children. Fatima, the author’s wife of many years, and their three children, Yousuf, Mustafa, and Ismael, survive him. There is little information available about the married couple’s relationship chronology. They seem to have been together for more than a decade.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ibrahim-Abdul-Matin-2.jpg alt="Ibrahim Abdul Matin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Abdul Matin Ibrahim Family Ethnicity</h2><p><strong>Ibrahim Abdul Matin</strong> was born to his parents in New York City in 1977. His mother and father subsequently turned to Islam as well. Ibrahim Abdul Matin is of African American descent. According to sources, the late author was motivated to become a steward of the planet and a Muslim environmentalist by his father. His father switched from Episcopal Christianity to Islam. Ibrahim’s father brought him to Bear Mountain, a hiker’s paradise when he was five years old and informed him that the world is a mosque and that he could worship anywhere he wished.</p><p>Because of these words, Ibrahim Abdul Matin chose to become a steward of the world and a Muslim environmentalist. Environmental stewardship, also known as earth stewardship, is the responsible use and upkeep of the world’s resources while realizing that they belong to God and that God has given us the honor of enjoying and caring for what He has created.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigm6qRnbauecCbm66kXaKutbXNZq6io5lixKmt06xkoaGjYrK1tM2imqKsqWK%2FprjIoKCopl2Wu6V5xZqkoqSpZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mind-your-manners-is-set-to-be-released-on-netflix-soon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mind Your Manners Is Set To Be Released On Netflix Soon">&larr;
