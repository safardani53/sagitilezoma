But personally, it was a tough time.</p><p>"When you are going through it, it is very painful. You are sitting in a room, and you feel the walls are closing in on you. You feel anxious and you don't know what it is. I think that is more painful than when you make a decision.</p><p>“The first few years were very painful because it was about two good people, it was not an abusive relationship. But it was like two kids had gotten married and sometimes two people evolve differently. There was a little bit of pressure to go back as well,” Mahira shared.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I knew that I would take my child but I knew that I didn't want to be dependent on anyone, not even my parents.
