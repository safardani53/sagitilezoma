wrongly believing it was the logo for Rockstar Games - the firm that produces violent video game Grand Theft Auto.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on OnlyFans">Read more on OnlyFans</h2><p>However, Lincolnshire Police have hit back and denied all allegations of bullying, misogyny and harassment, and told The Sun they treat such matters with "utmost seriousness".</p><p>Leanne was investigated for over two years amid accusations her attire in social media posts was not compatible&nbsp;with policing and that she was cashing by modelling- allegations she says were 100 percent untrue.</p><p>"The whole thing was ridiculous but it ruined my career, my relationship, and left me in a very bad place," said Leanne.</p><p>"I loved my job as a police officer and I was proud of what I achieved, but I felt I was knifed in the back by&nbsp;jealous colleagues and a force unwilling&nbsp;to get with the&nbsp;times.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>"They didn't like the fact that I had become a sergeant and then acting inspector so young, so my social media was an easy target.</p><p>"But I wasn't willing to roll over and let them dictate how I should live my life."</p><p>Leanne eventually left Lincolnshire Police two years ago, but was&nbsp;unable to speak about her case due to legal proceedings, which are no longer active.</p><p>She's since become a full-time personal trainer and fitness model and a <a href=#>social media influencer</a> with&nbsp;over&nbsp;151,000 <a href=#>Instagram</a> followers.</p><p>She also makes cash by posting X-rated content on her <a href=#>OnlyFans</a> account, streaming fitness routines and selling merchandise.</p><p>"The irony is I'm now making crazy money by doing what the police have accused me of doing all along, only this time it's genuine," she said.</p><p>"I've been on OnlyFans for almost a year, it generates a good income.</p><p>"The fact I can now earn a living after all the pain and hardship is pretty amazing.</p><p>"The irony is I'm now making crazy money by doing what the police have accused me of doing all along.</p><span class=quote-credit>Cop turned OnlyFans star Leanne Carr</span><p>"My reputation was completely destroyed, the police force destroyed a lot of things for me.</p><p>"But I'm a single parent with two wonderful children and I have to put a roof over their heads and give them a financially secure future."</p><p>Leanne, who has a degree in forensic science and criminology, first joined Lincolnshire <a href=#>Police</a> in 2006 starting out in the control room.</p><p>She then became a constable and took all the exams to be quickly promoted to sergeant by the age of 23.</p><p>But she claims her male colleagues couldn’t hack being bossed around by a younger woman, refusing to call her by her rank.&nbsp;</p><p>After years of petty anonymous reports against her under the force's "bad apple" complaints system things took a turn for the worse in 2015.</p><p>Leanne had been off sick after tearing her bicep during a police training exercise and she had also just passed the exams and interview process to become an inspector.</p><p>It was not long after that she was hit with her first misconduct charge.</p><p>"I was on duty on Christmas Day when I went to a male colleagues house so he could watch his children open their presents," she said.</p><p>"There was an understanding within the force that officers working over Christmas could be at home or at a family members, providing you had your radio on and answered any calls.</p><p>"But the misconduct papers said I neglected my duty by going to the officer's house. It was a ploy to get their teeth into me."</p><p>Leanne was under investigation for a year, lost her inspector rank and was moved to another police station 45 minutes away.</p><p>Ultimately the force found no evidence of misconduct.&nbsp;</p><p>"During that time I went off sick because my mental health declined significantly, I felt bullied and undermined," she said.</p><p>Then in August, 2016 Leanne was called in for an "ethical interview" following a series of further anonymous complaints from colleagues.</p><p>"One said I was wearing pink nail varnish to work, one complained I drove a Porsche, others alleged affairs with colleagues, none of it had anything to do with policing.</p><p>"It was then I was first accused of modelling for my partner's business because of the photos I was posting to social media.</p><p>"I told them I wasn't a <a href=#>model</a> and had never earned any money from it, it wasn't a side hustle.&nbsp;</p><p>"But they didn't believe me, they just used it as another stick to beat me with."</p><p>"Thousands of cops post holiday photos online every day, but I was penalised because mine looked better than everyone else's."</p><span class=quote-credit>Leanne Carr</span><p>Leanne was made to fill out a business interest form, despite telling the force she wasn't modelling.</p><p>"It was pointless, but they rejected it anyhow," she said.</p><p>Then Leanne hit the headlines in 2018 when glamorous shots emerged of her travelling in Thailand, Cyprus, Austria and South Africa, with allegations she had taken them while on long-term sick leave from Lincolnshire Police.</p><p>The copper, who had previously appeared in promotional material for the force, had shared provocative pictures of herself covering her breasts with pineapples and stretched out on a number of beaches in&nbsp;tiny bikinis.</p><p>But Leanne says none of the photos were taken when she was off work, but instead had been taken on annual&nbsp;leave and simply drip-fed onto her <a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram account</a> over time.</p><p>"I never stopped posting on social media, in a way it was my coping mechanism and I wanted to inspire others," she explained.</p><p>"My ex-boyfriend is a photographer and videographer, and I'm attractive and have a good body because I'm into my fitness.</p><p>"Thousands of cops post holiday photos online every day, but I was penalised because mine looked better than everyone else's."</p><p>Again top brass at Lincolnshire police accused Leanne of moonlighting as a professional model and influencer to make money.</p><p>But she claims she never made a penny from her social media accounts while&nbsp;working as a police&nbsp;officer.</p><p>Even after the&nbsp;ex inspector returned to her £45,000-a-year post she was accused of making money flaunting her cleavage while playing online video games, another thing she says wasn't true.</p><p>But this time Leanne was found guilty of misconduct for allegedly continuing to work as a model despite being rejected for a business interest application.&nbsp;</p><p>"I was placed back at a completely different station, the gossip, everyone's watching me, my mental health declined," she said.</p><p>"Then came the Rockstar allegations which didn't amount to anything, but I ended up going off sick due to work related stress.</p><p>"I eventually returned to work on restrictive duties, but went off on maternity leave in September, 2019.</p><p>"After that I couldn't face going back, I was suicidal and on anti-depressants."</p><p>Leanne quit the force in November, 2020 and took out legal proceedings against Lincolnshire Police.</p><p>In March this year, her legal team dropped her case nine days before the trial because she was posting pictures of her body on OnlyFans.</p><p>Leanne, who still dreams of returning to policing, to "make my kids proud", added: "I have been vilified and publicly humiliated because of the actions of Lincolnshire Police,&nbsp;but I wanted to speak out in the hope I can give some strength and courage to other people.</p><p>"If you believe in something then stand up for it, go with your heart and don't let people knock you down."</p><p>In a statement to The Sun, a spokesperson for Lincolnshire Police said: “A former Sergeant of Lincolnshire Police brought a claim for damages alleging bullying and harassment, which was denied by the force throughout.</p><p>"The former officer discontinued the claim earlier this year, one week before a trial of the allegations was due to commence.</p><p>“Any allegation of misogyny, bullying and corruption among officers or staff is concerning and is treated with the utmost seriousness.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"There are strong processes in place within Lincolnshire Police to support those who report such behaviour, to investigate thoroughly,&nbsp; and to hold those responsible to account.</p><p>"We urge anyone with evidence of such behaviour to make a formal complaint, which can then be investigated.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/leanne-carr-story-823781478.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/former-police-inspector-leanne-carr-823884211.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ395fphybmxnoKS5qq%2FEZpmupJyesqV50ZqasmWYpLmqsMCyZKymkaXAbr7Er5ynn5Vk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tammy-pescatelli-19690515-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tammy Pescatelli (Comedian) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp;
