Now that's how you clear up a rumor!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bossip</a>, Justine and Lil Yachty were spotted hanging out with one another on Jan. 23, 2022, in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood. While they weren't showing any PDA in the photos, their being together was enough to get social media talking.

On a Dec. 15, 2021 Instagram Live session, the songbird talked to fans about an incident where she caught an ex-boyfriend in a lie. And while she did not mention Giveon by name, fans are convinced she was speaking about him.</p><p>In the video, Justine said she found out that an ex whom she shared a home with cheated after he bought a new phone and left behind his old phone at their house. With access to his old phone, Justine claims that she caught him talking to at least 10 different women in real time. In fact, Justine claims that she finally told him he was caught when she watched a girl text him and say she “was outside” and “at his hotel.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Making matters worse, Justine says that her ex and his friends were trying to formulate a lie to tell Justine about the girl in question.</p><p>Even though Giveon didn't respond to any of Justine's claims, fans are sure that the story is about him, and are taking it as confirmation of what many already suspected: He is a liar and a cheater.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>This may be the reason why the star called their relationship quits some time in October 2021. Justine took to Twitter and posted a slew of revealing tweets on Oct. 12, 2021, and fans believe that she and the “For Tonight” singer broke up at that time.</p><p>In the tweets, Justine spoke about “people breaking her down,” cheaters staying true to their nature, and “letting those that she thought loved her break her." Plus, a now-deleted tweet (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bossip</a>) served as the ultimate confirmation for fans that she has ended her relationship.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“A man wouldn’t know how to treat you right if you gave them a manual. I know I shouldn’t, but I really can’t help but blame myself for not saving enough love for me in the end. Whatever. I don't care anymore. I’m done,” Justine wrote.</p><p>Giveon didn't posted any tweets of his own, remaining tight-lipped about the topic.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s like i’m a vase, it keeps cracking and i keep trying glue it back together to appear fine.
