Why is Caryn all up in ‘family’ stuff?"</p><h2>'SHE ALTERED THE DEAL' - ZACH</h2><p>Father Matt revealed that he put the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">farm up for sale</a>, despite his son expressing interest in buying a portion of the property earlier, and last week, Zach talked about it at length.</p><p>“My dad was definitely encouraging the conversation, [wife] Tori and [Matt’s girlfriend]&nbsp;Caryn&nbsp;came too."</p><p>“The north side is the 30 acres my mom and dad shared, and the whole thing was weird, he starts making excuses … suddenly me and my wife are not good enough to run the farm,” Zach shockingly explained in a confessional.</p><p>“Whether we don't have the money, don't have the skillset… Tori said, ‘it wasn't cool, I never wanna see someone talk to my husband like that ever.'”</p><p>“The price was more than I can afford - was going off of what my dad bought my mom out for.”</p><p>But Zach said Matt had raised that price to a much higher one.</p><p>"He went beyond the normal appreciation," he added.</p><p>He added: “I thought Caryn’s involvement altered it as well; ‘He can't do that’ [she would say].”</p><p>This aired after the news of Matt putting the home on the market, which the father of four detailed in a lengthy Instagram post.</p><p>He explained his reasoning behind the sale, claiming his "twin boys" could not work together "toward a possible joint sale."</p><p>Zach's twin brother Jeremy previously expressed interest in purchasing a part of the farm, though that also didn't materialize.</p><p>Matt claimed that&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeremy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Zach</a>&nbsp;"decided individually that the timing was not right for them to purchase a part of the farm at this time."</p><p>Besides Jeremy and Zach, the reality star also shares&nbsp;<a href=#>Jacob</a>, 25, and&nbsp;<a href=#>daughter Molly</a>, 28, with his ex-wife,&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy</a>, 57.&nbsp;</p><p>In the comments section, Zach accused his father of "manipulating the narrative right before the season" which has finally premiered on May 17.</p><h2>'THEY HAD THEIR CHANCE'</h2><p>Matt announced&nbsp;<a href=#>the sale</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=#>Oregon pumpkin farm</a>&nbsp;this month.</p><p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, Matt has asked for about $4million with the sale of the "original family home and bright red barn."</p><p><a href=#>LPBW</a>&nbsp;fans jumped at the comments section and slammed the TV personality for not selling&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the property</a>&nbsp;to his offspring.&nbsp;</p><p>One fan brought up Matt's children and asked: "None of the kids wanted to buy it?"</p><p>Matt responded: "<a href=#>They all had more than enough</a>… and very fair chances."</p><p>Back in March, Matt had planned on retiring and spending more time at his&nbsp;<a href=#>vacation home in Arizona</a>&nbsp;with his girlfriend.</p><p>A source close to the TV star told&nbsp;<a href=#>The Sun</a>&nbsp;at the time: "Matt would prefer Jacob and wife, Isabel, to take over the farm, but he's not sure they are on board at the moment."</p><p>Son Jacob no longer films with the show and has torn into his family&nbsp;<a href=#>for "selling their souls to TV."</a></p><p>Meanwhile, Zach has kept busy as his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wife gave birth</a>&nbsp;to their third child, baby Josiah on April 30.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On The Sun">Read More On The Sun</h2><p><a href=#>The happy couple is also parents</a>&nbsp;to son Jackson, four, and daughter Lilah, two - all of whom were sweetly seen on the season premiere - and whom Matt claimed he's <a href=#>"cut off" from seeing in the premiere of the long-running show.</a></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The family recently celebrated their oldest child's birthday with a&nbsp;<a href=#>massive backyard party</a>&nbsp;at their new Washington home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000733710024-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000726915592-6.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000733710022.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2htZGaCcn%2BXaKOpmqdiuqLA02apqKSfm7Nur8CrsKdllpa%2FrnnZmpqhZZ%2BrsrO%2F056nqaGenHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tim-mcgraw-faith-hill-through-the-years-relationship-photos-4277701.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Photos Of Them Then &amp;amp;
