TV series - and even a film - set across <a href=#>Miami</a> and <a href=#>Los Angeles</a>, with the pop group desperate to crack <a href=#>America</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rachel-stevens-jo-omeara-spice-244525.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rachel-stevens-paul-cattermole-jo-808426277-3.jpg><p>Their adventures even inspired a real-life Hollywood romance, with <a href=#>Hannah Spearritt</a> telling us how <a href=#>love blossomed off-set</a> with <a href=#>Paul Cattermole</a>, who was <a href=#>tragically found dead this month at 46</a>.</p><p>LA 7, the band's second TV series, is still CBBC’s most-watched show ever, with 90 million viewers across 100 countries.</p><p>But, while this translated into massive record sales in the UK, the highest any of their albums charted in the States was number 69.</p><p>That never stopped them trying, however, as we take a look inside S Club 7’s attempts at making it Stateside.</p><h2>Own colours and personality</h2><p>In 1999, just before S Club 7 brought out their first album S Club, the group were seen in CBBC show Miami 7, playing fictionalised versions of themselves, desperate to make it big in the music industry, but ending up working in a Fawlty Towers-style hotel.</p><p>Each episode would have at least one song from the album performed during it.</p><p>Co-created by Kim Fuller - who, unsurprisingly, also wrote the Spice Girls movie Spice World - the show saw each band member have their own unique colour palette to help kids tell the difference between them all, as well as their own exaggerated personality traits.</p><p>Jo O’Meara was the tough girl, Bradley McIntosh was always falling asleep, and <a href=#>Rachel Stevens</a>&nbsp; was the independent, pretty one.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Hannah has previously said she was given the yellow as her colour, because it matched her “bright and happy” outlook on life.</p><h2>Actually filmed in London</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NINTCHDBPICT000808495018.jpg><p>Although the show was meant to be set in Miami, the bulk of the filming actually took place in <a href=#>London</a>, due to financial and time constraints.</p><p>In total, the filming took around three months to complete, but only the exterior shots were done in <a href=#>Florida</a>.</p><p>All the shots taken inside the fictional Florida Paradise Hotel had already been filmed in the UK.</p><p>And once they were in Florida, it wasn’t glamorous at all.</p><h2>Staying in a ‘retirement village’</h2><p>At the S Club 7 reunion press conference, earlier this year, Tina Barrett explained they filmed the show’s 13 episodes in Fort Lauderdale rather than in Miami.&nbsp;</p><p>And she described the coastal location – 30 miles away from Miami – as being a “retirement village”.</p><p>She said: “In Miami, we were actually in a retirement village so it wasn’t actually as glamorous as it looked, but we sort of made it out to look a bit better.</p><p>“We did a little bit in Miami but most of it was in Fort Lauderdale, sleepy, sleepy.”</p><p>Paul did have some positives to add, however.</p><p>He said: “Two minute walk from the beach though, like literally 200 yards, in fact, so that was nice.”</p><p>And Rachel added: “Not a bad place for our first job.”</p><h2>15-hour filming days</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/08850f9f-b9d9-40a8-a17f-83c4be1fa179.jpg><p>Tina said that filming the second series of their show, LA 7, was “better,” as they all had their own apartments.</p><p>But the filming sounds hectic.</p><p>In a behind the scenes documentary released in 2000, Rachel says the group were filming for 15 days, with a couple of days off for “sunbathing and shopping”.</p><p>She also says these days were usually around 15 hours long.</p><h2>Blossoming romance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2001-revealing-dating-real-life-1969240.jpg><p>Thanks to these long days of filming, it was in LA that Hannah and Paul realised their relationship was more than just friendship.</p><p>Sharing pictures of their journey from teen wannabes to chart-topping stars, heartbroken Hannah exclusively told <a href=#>The Sun</a>: “We had all gone away, a big group of us skiing, and I started to feel a little bit jealous if Paul was flirting with anyone else.</p><p>“We had a bit of a drunken snog one night and then when we got back to LA it just kind of developed.</p><p>“We would go out on long drives together at night, up into the hills to watch the sun set.</p><p>"There was about a six-month period of us sneaking around.</p><p>"We were going to each other’s apartments and would stay over, but sneak out in the morning.”</p><p>The romance was even put into the show’s third series, Hollywood 7, as they shared an on-screen kiss in the episode, The Kiss.</p><p>Just a week before it aired, the pair confessed they had secretly been dating for six months and were ready to make their relationship official.</p><h2>'£150k a year'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/s-club-7-filming-la-810105521-2.jpg><p>S Club 7 were a huge success in the UK, with four number one singles, and every one of their 13 singles making it into the top 5, as well as their 2003 movie Seeing Double earning £2.8 million in the box office.</p><p>However, despite flogging more than 10 million records worldwide, the band members reportedly pocketed just £150,000 a year.</p><p>Hannah previously said: “We may not have got what we deserved in comparison to how much we made.”</p><h2>Disastrous Claudia Winkleman interview</h2><p>In 2003, <a href=#>Claudia Winkleman</a> tried her luck at asking the band about their finances in a disastrous interview on BBC 3’s Liquid News.</p><p>Chatting to the band, Claudia says: “Let’s talk cash... please don’t look at me like you are angry.</p><p>“There are rumours that you guys are grumpy because you guys haven’t made mint...”</p><p>Jon Lee quickly replies “no” before Hannah and Bradley start pretending they don’t understand the question and joke about edible mints.</p><p>Claudia persists: “Are you not grumpy about it at all?”</p><p>Jo jumps in, diplomatically responding: “I think we are all really really lucky to be where we are today at our age and have the bank balances that we do have.”</p><p>But the band’s publicist was far from happy, and jumps in to stop the interview.</p><p>She yells: “Can you not ask this question please? I’m not having it.</p><p>“I’ve tried to stop this and I’ve had to walk in here ... we are going.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Claudia defended her interview afterwards, saying: “It has been in the papers and they didn't give a list.&nbsp;</p><p>“You interview all sorts of people and you are told 'Actually, do you know what, don't ask this'... but they seemed fine."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvaG5%2Fc3yQaKpmm5yqr26DjK2tZqWfq7amec%2BarKVlk5bBtbHRpqalnV2drq%2B6wKFkrKiVlr%2BztdOtZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kandi-burruss-is-too-much-of-a-workaholic-to-bone-her-husband.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kandi Burruss Is Too Much of a Workaholic to Bone Her Husband">&larr;
