However, she was presumably born sometime between 1988 to 1992 in El Salvador, Central America. Further, the detail regarding her parents or other family members remains in the dark.</p><p>Also, she is of Latin American origin and is a proud citizen of the United States of America. Hence, Ramirez is fluent in both English and Spanish. But, the story about her journey to the USA is hidden from the public’s eye.</p><p>Despite being in a romantic relationship with a famous athlete, the entirety of her life is obscured.</p><p>The only part of her early life we do know is that she was a student at the University of California, Los Angeles, and graduated with two degrees.</p><h2>Giselle Ramirez | Age, Height, & Body Measurements</h2><p>Although we are unaware of her birthdate, if we base it on JaVale’s age, Giselle is around 31 to 35 years old. Whatever her age may be, Ramirez’s social media presence suggests that she is eye candy.</p><p>Added to that, the former model appears to be about 5’8″ (1.76 m), opposite to her beau’s towering stature of 7’0″ (2.1 m). Regardless, the two perfectly complement each other.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gisselle-Posing-With-A-Bike.jpg></p><p>On the other hand, several Instagram posts revealed that Ramirez is a huge fitness geek.</p><p>The entirety of her posts are related to health and exercise, and to top it off, she posts pictures of her in dresses that accentuate her voluptuous frame and also of her family.</p><p>We can safely say that Ms. Ramirez slays every time she steps out.</p><p>Giselle’s beautiful frame is not due to fitness trends but her involvement as a model before she hopped onto the real estate business.</p><p>the Salvadoran is not only aesthetics; she is a committed mother and a hardworking realtor.</p><p>Most importantly, the Latin model’s distinguishing features are her monolid eyes, squared jawlines, plump lips, and high-arched eyebrows. In short, <a href=# rel=noopener>JaVale McGee</a> found a&nbsp; carefully sculpted work of art.</p><h2>Giselle Ramirez | Career As A Realtor</h2><p>Before working as a real estate agent, Giselle was a model. There is not much evidence to attest to the fact, but there was one instance when she had a shot with Milan Garter.</p><p>Well, isn’t her Instagram proof enough to classify her as a model?</p><p>However, she started low-key in sales operation in a Media company in the entertainment industry. Then, later in 2011, she started working as a model.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Giselle-A-Realter-An-Actress-And-A-Mother.jpg></p><p>She is also an actress and was featured in the 2014 comedy romance drama, Obvious Child, although she had a minor role of a bar extra. There is nothing more information regarding her acting career.</p><p>Anyway, let’s move on to her current profession as a realtor for Rodeo Realty. Apart from posing in ravishing dresses, Ramirez keenly shares her work and advertises various residences, from affordable to luxurious ranges, on her social media.</p><p>Honestly, she is one of the most independent women we can ever see.</p><p>Even though she is married to one of the highest-earning players in the NBA, Giselle likes her freedom, and dealing in real states is her guilty pleasure.</p><p>On the contrary, we all know what JaVale does. The 7-foot-tall NBA star plays as a center for the LA Lakers.</p><p>Throughout his active playing career, McGee played for Washington Wizards, Denver Nuggets, Philadelphia 76ers, Dallas Mavericks, and Golden State Warriors.</p><p><strong>Learn About <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Veronica Stigeler Bio: Age, Height, Birthday, Music, Husband, Kids Wiki>></a></strong></p><h2>Giselle Ramirez | Net Worth, Salary & Income</h2><p>To begin with, no sources have come forth to mention the exact figure of her net worth, but we can assume that the Latina has a net worth of over <strong>$500k</strong>.</p><p>However, we are talking about Ramirez, who sells property worth in a six-digit range.
