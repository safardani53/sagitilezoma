People born in the year of the tiger are self-sufficient and have great self-esteem. They adore being the defender and leader of ordinary people. They are passionate about justice and will never give up an argument. Their main flaw is their recklessness, which causes them to fail. They never, however, genuinely fail. Tigers will always find a way to recover and triumph in the end.</p><p>People born on February 27 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Pisces</strong>. There would almost certainly be an image of Pisces next to the term "psychic" in the dictionary. Pisces is the zodiac's most perceptive, sensitive, and empathic sign, and that's because it's the last of the last. Pisces, as the final sign, has absorbed every lesson taught by the preceding signs, including the pleasures and sorrows, hopes and anxieties. It is represented as two fish swimming in opposite directions, symbolizing Pisces' continual divide of attention between imagination and reality.</p><p>Italian fashion designer who is best known for his popular Instagram account featuring his designs and other fashion-centric posts.
