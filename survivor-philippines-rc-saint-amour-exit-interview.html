Strategic and athletic, she formed a strong alliance on day one – only to watch her tribemates turn on her and vote her out on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>day 19</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She tells PEOPLE about what went wrong and what she really thinks of the tribe that booted her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>How did you get on the show in the first place?</b><br>Oh, I was a huge fan of Survivor. I had seen every episode. I had dreamed about being on the show for years, so I applied. When they called me back, I was like, “Are you sure you’re talking to the right person?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>So you got on the show and formed an alliance with Abi Maria Gomes on day one. How did that happen?</b><br>You know, she looked like she wanted to be in an alliance with me, and I thought she’d be good to align with. I wanted a strong, smart, strategic female. And we brought in Pete [Yurkowski, a 24-year-old engineering graduate]. We formed a bond right away, but clearly it didn’t work out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>I know! Watching it fall apart was horrible.</b><br>It’s a helpless feeling when someone backstabs you – especially because she was operating under incorrect assumptions. I thought she could be a good thinker to work with. But when that door closed, it was slammed shut and locked. I knew my chances of winning the game were pretty much wiped away. It was really unfortunate, because I thought we could have been friends.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>She teamed up with Pete and they voted you out. Why?</b><br>There was no good reason. She was obviously very threatened by me. I’m everything that she’s not – both in the game and in life – and she hated me for that. Pete knew he couldn’t control me. So I really take it as a compliment that so many people thought I was dangerous.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>You also had a falling out with Artis right after the diving challenge where you performed so well. What happened?</b><br>I’ve been a competitive swimmer since I was five, so I was in my element. We had a bunch of athletes on our tribe, and we all think that we’re superstars. But this was a challenge I could do well. There are other challenges that other people will excel at, but I knew this was one for me. And when I stepped up, it rubbed certain people the wrong way. Their egos couldn’t take it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Sounds like your tribe was dysfunctional.</b><br>It was, but you know, we came together at challenge time and did really well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>On the flip side, you got along well with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lisa Whelchel</a>. Did you recognize her?</b><br>I didn’t know who she was! I wasn’t born when her show was on. But I always knew she was hiding something while she was on the island. She could be evasive. If I had known that was all she was hiding, I would have been at ease. I didn’t care if she was a child actress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>You were also aligned with former player <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mike Skupin</a>.</b><br>I was starstruck being on a team with him. He was a dream come true. He played with integrity and leadership the first time around. So I was thrilled.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>But in the end, he didn’t vote with you.</b><br>I love Mike. I still love him. He was obviously out for himself. He was trying to win a million dollars. So was I. So was everybody else. So I don’t blame him. But of course I wish he would have voted with me.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>So after watching Survivor for 24 seasons, what was it like playing the game?</b><br>I had the best time of my entire life. I spent so long hoping and praying that I would have that adventure, and it was something better than I could ever imagine. No, I didn’t win. But I enjoyed every minute of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfLTB0a%2Bgr6eiYr2ptcuip6mhnprAbr7CZqqaoZ6peqK5zq6pZp2onsFutc2tnKuumZrEcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./suze-orman-how-to-win-cash-alliant.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Suze Orman reveals how savers can win $10,000 - but you'll need to be quick">&larr;
