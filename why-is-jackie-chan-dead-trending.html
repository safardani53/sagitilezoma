the <a href=#>celebrity death hoax</a>, with dozens of actors, musicians, and entertainers falling victim to the cruel online trend, the latest being <a href=#>Jackie Chan</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

is a <a href=#>Hong Kong</a> entertainer, actor, <a href=#>stuntman</a>, and <a href=#>martial artist</a>.</p><p>He was born on April 7, 1954 in <a href=#>British Hong Kong</a>.</p><p>Jackie Chan is best known for his acrobatic fighting style and comedic timing, which he's incorporated into dozens of <a href=#>movies</a> over the years.</p><p>He's received stars on the <a href=#>Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> and the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars and is recognized as a global megastar.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Death Hoaxes">Read More on Death Hoaxes</h2><p>Chan has even progressed from acting to music, releasing several albums and theme songs for his feature films.</p><p>He's worked with the Jackie Chan Stunt Team, a group of martial artists and trained stuntmen, for most of his films since the group was established in the 1970s.</p><p>Jackie Chan has been acting <a href=#>since he was a child</a>, making his debut in the 1962 Hong Kong film Big and Little Wong Tin Bar, also known as Seven Little Valiant Fighters.</p><p>Chan's filmography includes over 150 movies, four TV series, and multiple reality TV show appearances.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>He is perhaps best known in Hollywood for starring as Chief Inspector Lee in the Rush Hour film series alongside <a href=#>Chris Tucker</a>, who was also the <a href=#>target of a celebrity death hoax in 2022</a>.</p><p>He also starred as Chon Wang, a homophone for John Wayne, in the movie series Shanghai Noon alongside <a href=#>Owen Wilson</a> and <a href=#>Lucy Liu</a>.</p><p>While Jackie Chan is known for his comedic roles and action-packed blockbusters, he's also appeared in dramas, including the 2010 remake <a href=#>The Karate Kid</a> alongside <a href=#>Will Smith</a> and <a href=#>Jada Pinkett-Smith's</a> son, <a href=#>Jaden Smith</a>.</p><p>Chan has also progressed beyond acting, having directed and produced numerous movies in <a href=#>Hollywood</a> and Hong Kong.</p><p>He most recently appeared in the animated movie, <a href=#>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem</a> in 2023, voicing Splinter, a mutant rat, ninjutsu, and the Turtles' adoptive father.</p><p>He is also set to star in <a href=#>Rush Hour 4</a>, confirming in December 2022 that the fourth installment was in development.</p><p>In 2016, he received an <a href=#>Academy Honorary Award</a> for his extraordinary achievements in film.</p><p>The honorary <a href=#>Oscar</a> was just one of the dozens of awards and accolades he's received globally.</p><p>The worldwide star speaks many languages and is fluent in <a href=#>Cantonese</a>, <a href=#>Mandarin</a>, English, and <a href=#>American Sign Language</a>.</p><p>He also speaks <a href=#>German</a>, Spanish, <a href=#>Korean</a>, <a href=#>Thai</a>, and <a href=#>Japanese</a>.</p><p>Chan has been <a href=#>married to Joan Lin</a>, a former <a href=#>Taiwanese</a> actress, since 1982, and has two children, including <a href=#>Etta Ng Chok Lam</a>.</p><p>Lam is married to <a href=#>Canadian influencer, Andi Autumn</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why is 'Jackie Chan dead' trending?</h2><p>Jackie Chan's most recent <a href=#>death hoax</a> occurred in December 2023, when multiple tweets surfaced that the actor had passed away.</p><p>Fortunately, the <a href=#>news wasn't true</a>, and the tweets were quickly disproven.</p><p>This wasn't Jackie Chan's first <a href=#>death hoax</a> rodeo.</p><p>The actor has had to disprove dozens of <a href=#>death rumors</a> in the past.</p><p>He most recently had <a href=#>death hoaxes</a> spread about him in 2011, 2013, 2015, 2020, and 2021.</p><p>Jackie Chan's insistence on performing his own stunts throughout the years has made him an easy target for the <a href=#>death hoax</a> rumors.</p><p>Chan has injured himself plenty of times over the years, breaking his back, spraining ankles, and injuring his neck while shooting films or practicing his stunt work.</p><p>His most dramatic injury happened in 1986, on the set of Armour of God.</p><p>Chan's character in the film was required to jump from a castle wall onto a tree branch.</p><p>When attempting the jump, the branch broke, and Chan landed headfirst on the ground.</p><p>He required <a href=#>emergency surgery</a>, with doctors operating on his brain for eight hours to fix his fractured skull.</p><p>It was the closest the acclaimed star had come to death, though thanks to the internet, he's "died" plenty of times since then, warding off one <a href=#>fake death rumor</a> after another.</p><p>Earlier in the year, in July 2023, Jackie Chan revealed another near-death experience that happened to him while filming the 2020 movie Vanguard.</p><p>The actor had been performing a water stunt when he nearly drowned after being unexpectedly trapped underwater by a large rock.</p><p>As reported by <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fandom Wire</a>, during a press conference in <a href=#>Beijing</a>, Jackie Chan said: "When I took a shower later that night and remembered the incident, I suddenly felt really scared and started shaking."</p><p>"I was thinking about how I could have so easily died," he added.</p><img

hoax?</h2><p>With the rise of <a href=#>social media</a> platforms like <a href=#>Facebook</a>, <a href=#>Instagram</a>, and <a href=#>TikTok</a>, <a href=#>celebrity death hoaxes</a> have become all too common.</p><p>That doesn't stop users from <a href=#>believing the rumors</a>, or from <a href=#>sharing their thoughts</a> on platforms like <a href=#>X</a>, formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><p>One user chose to <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">poke fun at the rumors</a>, posting a black-and-white photo of Jackie Chan smiling with the caption: "#BREAKING Jackie Chan peacefully passed by a grocery store in Hong Kong today at age 64."</p><p>Some users were quick to point out the age discrepancy – Jackie Chan is, in fact, not 64 years old – while others reacted by responding to the tweet with crying laughing emojis.</p><p>One <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">disgruntled user even wrote</a>: "god got a special place in h*ll waiting for you."</p><p>One user remembered that this situation had happened before, tweeting: "lol, not this sh*t again, i remember when i was in highschool people was thinking Jackie Chan was actually dead."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In 2021, one of the last times 'Jackie Chan dead' was trending, <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">one user tweeted</a>: "Rest easy Jackie Chan," alongside the prayer hands and a white dove emoji.</p><p>He added: "he ain't dead but it's probably bed time in China," next to a bed and Zzz emojis.</p><p class=postsid
