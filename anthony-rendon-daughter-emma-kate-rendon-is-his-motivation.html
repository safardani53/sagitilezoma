The baseballer is a father to Emma, Savannah, and a set of twins.</strong></p><p>A man who keeps his life away from social media, many of his fans might not have even known he had welcomed a set of twins. And like him, his wife is also not a fanatic user of social media.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/anthony-rendon-family.jpg><p>Amanda and Anthony have been previously seen with their daughter, Emma, only during charitable works. They have yet to share pictures of their twins.</p><p>Since signing the $245 million deal with the Angels in 2019, Rendon is yet to play 60 games in a season. The deal came after he became World Series Champion with the Nationals and teammates <a href=# rel=noopener>Trea Turner</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Stephen Strasburg</a>.</p><p>In recent years, Rendon has been unlucky with injuries. And once again, he has been placed on the ten days injury list and has been replaced by Kevin Padlo.&nbsp;</p><h2>Anthony Rendon Daughter, Emma Kate Rendon</h2><p>Anthony Rendon’s first daughter, Emma Kate Rendon, was born on July 25, 2018. The first of four children of the third baseman and his wife, Amanda Rendon.&nbsp;</p><p>The star player of the Angels, Rendon, has tried to keep his family away from the public limelight. He doesn’t have any social media handles, and his wife, Amanda, last updated her Instagram in 2020.</p><p>But before quitting using Instagram, Amanda did share a glimpse of her daughter, Emma celebrating her second birthday. Her last picture was also that of a family portrait of her, Anthony, and their two kids.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/anthony-rendon-daughter-emma.jpg><p>Previously, Anthony and Emma were clicked together for the Baseball For Babies campaign. They were part of the campaign as Emma was a premature baby, born two months earlier.</p><p>Previously, when her dad was a player for the Nationals, Emma was brought out by her mom for the Dream Foundations mystery bags campaign. The apple of her father’s eye, Emma wore the Nationals jersey and rocked a red ribbon for the occasion.&nbsp;</p><p>If Emma has appeared a fair bit in the media, her siblings are completely out of the spotlight. Her second sister, Savannah, was born in February 2020, and she also has twin siblings in Levi and Dakota.&nbsp;</p><h2>Anthony Rendon Wife, Amanda Rendon&nbsp;</h2><p>Anthony Rendon’s wife, Amanda Rendon, despite being the better half of an MLB star, has tried to keep herself out of the public eye. The couple tied the knot in November 2017 in Houston, Texas, where Anthony was born and raised.&nbsp;</p><p>They had a beautiful indoor wedding, with a few of the pictures of their wedding surfacing on the <a href=# rel=noopener>website</a> of their wedding photographers, Josh and Dana. And as pretty as their wedding photographs are, the couple even have a cuter engagement story.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/anthony-rendon-wife.jpg><p>A regular visitor of the Texas city, Fredericksburg, during Amanda’s birthday, one year Anthony suggested Amanda visit the city all by themselves. She agreed, and with their new puppies, the couple took off.&nbsp;</p><p>And one day, before dinner, the couple decided to go for a walk, which turned out to be quite a hassle, with Anthony dead set to find a scenic outlook. During the walk, as Amanda started to get ahead of Anthony, she looked behind and suddenly saw the baseballer down on one knee.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the years, Amanda and Anthony have been involved with various charities. Previously, they donated $150,000 to the Washington Nationals Youth Baseball Academy.</p><p>Amanda also used to be involved with other Nationals’ wives for charitable events. Though fans would want to know more about Anthony Rendon’s family life, sometimes, it could be best for famous families like his to stay away from the limelight.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCtza2fqKapYr%2BmusOopWackaq0qcDEq2SepZ2Weqyt055kq52embyvecisZKGho2K6sMDIr5itoZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chad-bradford.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Chad Bradford net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
