In fact, she was nearly 30 when she nabbed her first film role in 1999's The Best Man, and before breaking into Hollywood, she held down jobs as a dental hygienist and a waitress serving damn fine cups of coffee in a Twin Peaks themed restaurant.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But while plenty is known about the actress's professional life, she's a lot more guarded when it comes to her personal life.&nbsp;Fans often wonder if Regina Hall is married or ever has been, and her close friendship with Sanaa Lathan has raised a couple eyebrows over the years. Well, here's the tea.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Regina Hall has never married, but she once tried to marry God.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Though she isn't Catholic, Regina attended Catholic school in her youth and even graduated from the oldest Catholic university in the United States, Fordham, University. And she has always been attracted to a spiritual path, once jokingly calling the Dalai Lama her boyfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Growing up, she thought she wanted to become a nun, and in the early 2000s, she seriously considered revisiting that dream after a breakup. But it wasn't a fear of giving up sex that prevented her from joining a convent. "I never thought about walking away from anything," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times Magazine</a> in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>"I thought of walking to something. Think of Mother Teresa. I’m not like, 'Oh, Mother Teresa never got to have sex.' When I was thinking about becoming a nun, I had gone through a breakup. I wasn’t having sex anyway. I thought being a nun would be peaceful."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>However, the order she was interested in had a maximum age for women to join, and a few other barriers that excluded her. "There were a couple things in my way," she says. "I could’ve lied about them, but I didn’t want to start off as a nun like that."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The Catholic church's loss was our gain, though, because if Regina had taken her vows, she wouldn't have gone on to make Girls Trip or star in shows like Insecure and Black Monday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Her close friendship with Sanaa Lathan has raised speculation Regina is gay.</h2><p>While Sanaa and Regina have never claimed to be anything more than best friends, that didn't stop people from talking when Regina, who has known Sanaa since they played sisters in Love and Basketball, moved in with Sanaa while her own home was getting repairs. However, it seems most likely the bond between the two is sisterly, both on-screen and off.</p><p>Regina, who is a vocal supporter of the queer community, has said she would never deny being in a relationship with a woman if it were true. "If I was with a woman, that wouldn’t be anything I’d be ashamed of or try to hide," she told NewNowNext in 2019. "It wouldn’t be Sanaa, though, because she’s like my sister."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The rumors don't bother her, though. In fact, she thinks they're cute, which is probably why she doesn't go out of her way to deny them. If she were to consider dating a woman, however, her No. 1 pick is Rihanna. Good taste!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuvsSgoKeZXZ2urbiMppirqpmasQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./meryl-streeps-vigil-for-dying-boyfriend-and-marriage-to-don-gummer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meryl Streep's Marriage to Don Gummer">&larr;
