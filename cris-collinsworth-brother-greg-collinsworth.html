However, not many know of his late younger brother, Greg Collinsworth.</p><p>The two brothers were like best friends, and Cris struggled to cope after Greg’s untimely death.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-design-3.png><p><a href=#>Anthony Cris Collinsworth</a> is a 64-year-old former NFL player who currently is an established sports broadcaster.&nbsp;</p><p>Cris hails from Dayton, Ohio, and comes from a family of educators. However, his father did have a background in sports, as he played and coached basketball.</p><p>Furthermore, the Collinsworth family moved to Florida with their two sons, Cris and Greg. The two brothers attended Astronaut High School, where their father was the principal.</p><p>Moreover, Cris started his sporting journey in high school through multiple sports.&nbsp;</p><p>Cris played in the NCAA, representing the University of Florida. His contributions got him inducted into both Students and Athletic Hall of Fame.</p><p>The “Gator Great” got drafted as the No. 37 pick in the 1981 NFL Draft. He played eight seasons in the NFL, spending his whole career with the Bengals.</p><h2>Meet Greg Collinsworth: Brother of Cris Collinsworth</h2><p>Cris Collinsworth was not the only talented sportsman in the Collinsworth household.</p><p>While Cris made a name for himself in football, his brother Greg flourished in multiple sports.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Late-Greg-Collinsworth.jpg><p>Greg Collinsworth was the youngest son of Abraham Lincoln Collinsworth and Donetta Browning Collinsworth. He was born just a year and a half apart from his older brother Cris.</p><p>Following in his top-scorer father’s footsteps, he opted for basketball instead of football, unlike his brother. On top of that, he joined his brother’s rival college, Florida State University.</p><p>Apart from sports, Greg later turned into a monetary organizer. And his older brother Cris was one of his clients.</p><p>Greg was a larger-than-life character. Sadly, he was taken away too soon, leaving a hole in his family, especially his brother’s life.</p><h3>Greg Collinsworth Death: His Impact on Cris Collinsworth’s Life And Broadcasting</h3><p>The broadcaster’s younger brother had a significant impact on his day-to-day life.&nbsp;</p><p>“There is some other half of everybody in the world, and he was the other half of me,” Cris said.</p><p>Greg Collinsworth died of Colon Cancer. Despite his brother taking him to Cincinnati for first-class treatment, he couldn’t survive the long battle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cris-Collinsworth-Broadcasting-For-NBC-Sports.jpg><p>Cris still remembers the little things Greg used to do for his brother. Like, create flip cards with color-coded, detailed information on each player to help with his broadcasting.</p><p>“If people only knew how many times he was my big brother and those times when I had to count on him to be strong.”</p><p>Furthermore, following Greg’s death, Cris used <a href=# rel=noopener>football as a primary form of distraction</a>. He never missed a single broadcasting session and is deeply thankful to his brother for his sacrifices.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCv0aKqZpufobmqutKwpqusmGKvs7vToZyrZZensqh5wqijpaGeqMSwvtOhZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./drunk-man-tries-to-fight-reflection.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Drunk Man Tries to Fight His Reflection in a Karaoke Bar, Internet Goes Wild">&larr;
