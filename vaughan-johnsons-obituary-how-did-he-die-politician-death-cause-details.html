He moved to Queensland, where he served on the Quilpie Shire Council from 1970 to 1973. From 1972 to 1973, he was the Chairman of the National Party’s Quilpie Branch. In 1989, Johnson was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly to represent Gregory for the National Party. Vaughan joined the Liberal National Party with the Queensland Nationals in 2008 and remained there until his retirement in 2015. After Rob Borbidge was elected Premier, Johnson was named Minister for Transport and Main Roads.</p><p>Following the 2001 election, he was appointed deputy national Leader, a post he held until Lawrence Springborg replaced Mike Horan as Leader in 2003. He served in a number of shadow cabinet roles between 1998 and 2010, including Shadow Minister for Sport and Shadow Minister for Police and Corrections.</p><p>He returned when Campbell Newman replaced Langbroek as Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Western Queensland. He was appointed Government Chief Whip after the LNP won the 2012 election. Johnson announced in October 2014 that he will resign from the Queensland Legislature in the next election.</p><h2>Is Former Queensland Politician Vaughan Johnson Dead From Kidney Disease?</h2><p>Unfortunately, <strong>Vaughan Johnson’s Death</strong> news is true, as the lawmaker died on January 22. However, Kidney Disease was not the reason for Vaughan Johnson’s death. Unfortunately, the actual cause of his death has yet to be released to the public, but Vaughan Johnson was an American professional football player who died of renal illness.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Vaughan-Johnson-1.jpg alt="Vaughan Johnson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Johnson, an American professional football player, died from renal disease on December 12, 2019, at the age of 57, and many people connect his death with that of politician Vaughan Johnson. Vaughan Johnson, a former Queensland politician and recipient of the Order of Australia, died today.&nbsp;The 75-year-old former National Party and Liberal National Party member served in the Queensland legislature for 25 years.&nbsp;Mr. Johnson was hailed as a “advocate” and “champion” for rural Queensland by colleagues from both political parties.</p><h2>Vaughan Johnson’s Net Worth at the Time of His Death</h2><p>Vaughan was a bit tight-lipped about his personal details, such as his financial worth, since the politician had not divulged anything about it while he was with us.&nbsp;Vaughan Johnson’s net worth was above $5 million at the time of his death, according to several reports. However, authorities have yet to authenticate this information.&nbsp;Unfortunately, since the politician required social media accounts such as Instagram, no information about his lifestyle and interests was discovered at the time of writing this piece.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Vaughan-Johnson-2.jpg alt="Vaughan Johnson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Many people adored Vaughan, and condolences poured in when Vaughan Johnson’s death was announced. Mr. Johnson was “fiercely devoted and a determined champion for his towns in western Queensland,” according to Senator Susan McDonald, who remembers him. Senator McDonald said that Vaughan “always had a colorful use of the phrase” such as “country so good you can plant a feather and grow a chook.”&nbsp;“They broke the mold after Vaughan, so I was shocked to learn of his death.” “May the force be with you.” Mr. Johnson has been described as a “gentleman and a strong advocate for our areas” by Agriculture Minister Mark Furner.&nbsp;Nanango MP Deb Frecklington said Mr. Johnson will not be forgotten. “A tough old bugger who also happened to be a great friend and coworker.” “I wish you a restful night’s sleep.”She wrote in a Facebook post.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGitmq2Xna6vecmon6ern6PAbrvBoquumaKueqm71mabopxdnbJusMieZKmnnJ7Bqq%2FImqVmnJWWwal5wpqsrJ1dmbK1rcilqmg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./aaron-goodwins-girlfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Aaron Goodwin Dating  Aaron Goodwin's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes">&larr;
