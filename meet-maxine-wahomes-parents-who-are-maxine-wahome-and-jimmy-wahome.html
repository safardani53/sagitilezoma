She began her racing career in autocross before going on to motocross. In June 2022, she made her début at the Naivasha Safari Rally and won the WRC3 title. The co-driver, Waigwa Murage, coached her. She won the inaugural Lioness Rally, held in Kasarani in March 2022. Safina Khan was in charge of directing her movements. Maxine Wahome made news for the wrong reasons again on December 13, 2022, when she reportedly participated in a love triangle with her 50-year lover Asad Khan.</p><p>Asad Khan was admitted to the hospital for severe blood loss from his Achilles. Bail had been used to release her. On social media, GBV activists demanded that Safaricom PLC and Betika quit financing them. It has become more common for celebrities to be in the news for the wrong reasons.</p><h2>Who Is Maxine Wahome’s Father, Jimmy Wahome, And Mother?</h2><p>Maxine Wahome’s father Jimmy Wahome is a former rally driver. Unfortunately, no additional information about him was discovered, since Jimmy seems to be a bit guarded about his data. Similarly, Maxine has yet to reveal any information on her mother to her admirers, such as her name, age, employment, and so on, thus no more information about her was uncovered on the web. Maxine has also not disclosed any information about her siblings. She hasn’t shared a single photo of her family on social media, such as Instagram, thus no information about them is accessible.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Maxine-Wahome-1.jpg alt="Maxine Wahome" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>On Instagram, where she goes by the name @maxine_wahome_rally, she usually posts images of herself and her rally vehicle. She has over 2k followers and seems to be quite active since she refreshes her profile.&nbsp;Unfortunately, no additional information about Maxine Wahome Father was discovered, since Jimmy seems to be a bit protective about his data.</p><h2>Maxine Wahome Net Worth 2023</h2><p>Maxine seems to be a bit guarded about her specifics, such as her net worth, since the racer has yet to reveal much information on the subject with her admirers.&nbsp;According to several reports, her net worth is expected to exceed $500,000 by 2023. This information, however, has yet to be verified by the racer herself. Despite the fact that Maxine has a lucrative business, she seems to prefer spending her money on items other than her automobile. She has yet to share a single image on social media of herself wearing pricey clothing, designer shoes, and other accessories.</p><h2>Is Maxine Wahome’s boyfriend still alive?</h2><p>No, Maxine Wahome’s boyfriend is still alive and being treated at Avenue Hospital. Following the incident, he was taken to Nairobi Hospital before being sorted in Avenue. Maxine Wahome had been living with Khan for some time when she assaulted him at his home.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Maxine-Wahome-2.jpg alt="Maxine Wahome" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Khan’s girlfriend, Wahome, was seized on December 12 at her Kilimani residence after Adila Khan, Khan’s brother, reported the incident.&nbsp;Despite the fact that the victim deserves justice, she was freed on KSh. 100,000 cash bail.&nbsp;He was apparently in a coma when the death rumors began, but his parents subsequently said that he was still alive and fighting for his life.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiknp2kYrqixMinnGavkZ28rrHSZqeaqpWjwbR51qGmZpmimnqurdeipZ5lp5a1sLnEZpinnF2ftq652GaumqCforJw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./victor-cibrian-wnm6-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Victor Cibrian (Songwriter) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
