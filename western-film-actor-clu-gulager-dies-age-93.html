Loud and dangerous," they said.</p><p>His most recent films include: Tangerine in 2015, Blue Jay in 2016, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood in 2019.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more in celebrity deaths">Read more in celebrity deaths</h2><p>The tv star also appeared in horror films such as The Return of the Living Dead and A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge, both of which premiered in 1985.</p><p>In 2019, Gulager recalled what it was like to be a cowboy turned actor.</p><p>“And then later on, you move on and something comes over you, and you want to be an actor. Well, I could play a cowboy, and it was easy for me to ride a pony and wear a hat,” he said.</p><p>Back in 1964, Gulager played Charlie Strom, the ultimate hitman, with Ronald Reagan who played a mob boss in The Killers.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>“I was surprised that Lee Marvin let me do all that stuff, actually,” Gulager said in a 2020 interview.</p><p>“But the director wanted me to invent some things to [make the character] a psychotic, really a nut. So I tried to go along with that," he said.</p><p>The star's performance in The Killers landed him the role of the caddish oil-field foreman in The Last Picture Show.</p><p>In 1960, Gulager played the iconic Billy the Kid with Barry Sullivan as Pat Garett in The Tall Man.</p><p>The series ended in two short seasons, partly because Congress didn't like how Billy, a criminal, was being "inaccurately" portrayed as a hero to younger viewers, according to The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>However, Gulager pointed out in a 2015 interview that The Untouchables was very violent and still allowed to be aired.</p><p>“I played a character on that called ‘Mad Dog’ Coll where I shot a horse in a horse race, killed a little boy in Brooklyn and cut off a bartender’s fingers," the star said.</p><p>"But they left that on because they thought that show was historically accurate," said Gulager.</p><p>The Hollywood icon also appeared on more than 50 episodes of The Virginian from 1964 to 1968.</p><p>He played Deputy Sheriff Emmett Ryker alongside tv stars James Drury and Doug McClure.</p><p>“I was broke when I stepped onto [The Virginian],” he&nbsp;said&nbsp;in a 2014 interview.</p><p>“I had to ask Frank Price, who ran it, for a job. He fired an actor off the set and hired me. Had I known he had fired someone, I would not have accepted the job,” Gulager said.</p><p>Some of Gulager's other roles included a race car mechanic in Winning with Paul Newman and a detective in McQ with John Wayne.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Gulager also worked on films that his son, John, directed such as the horror film Feast in 2005 and its two sequels and Piranha 3DD in 2012.</p><p>The star was married to singer-actress Miriam Byrd-Nethery from 1952 to 2003, after she had passed away.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2htaWmEenyRaK6eq6Sav695xaKjpmWRmMGwvoyco65ll6q5orPEq2SdoZWoeqKzxGZwbGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kara-dioguardi-reality-show-coming-to-bravo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kara DioGuardi Reality Show: Coming to Bravo!">&larr;
