Wiz just released his sixth studio album, Multiverse, and the event was meant to be a celebration of that release. Wiz Khalifa’s rage was directed towards DJ Mike Danger and MC Tron, who, according to rumors, we’re not playing tracks from Wiz Khalifa’s album. The rapper may be heard stating in videos that have gone viral:</p><p>“B*tch ass n****, if you want to fight, n**** we can do it,” Wiz begins the video. “Y’all n****s stink, b*tch, don’t embrace me.” Play my new sh*t n****, play it n****, play ‘Bad Ass B*tches,’ y’all n****s suck. You guys are terrible DJs.”</p><p>He continued his rage on stage, saying:</p><p>“I came here tonight to advertise for y’all and have a good time, but you know what I’m not going to do? I’m not going to sit here and let these jerks pretend like this is okay. My record just came out today, and I’m a genuine ass n**** dawg. My record was just released today, so listen to my new sh*t, dawg.”</p><p>On stage, the rapper also shoved someone away from him and said:</p><p>“Get out of my way, dawg, I don’t like you.”</p><p>Enraged, the rapper allegedly snatched the two people’s caps and flung them into the throng.</p><h2>Wiz Khalifa’s latest album, Multiverse, is out now.</h2><p>Wiz Khalifa’s new album Multiverse was released earlier this week on all major streaming sites, including Spotify. The CD is about an hour long and contains performances by Girl Talk and THEY. Khalifa said that the goal of releasing the new album was to create something fresh for him.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Wiz-Khalifa-1.jpeg alt="Wiz Khalifa" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to Stereogum, the artist stated:</p><p>“The album sort of took form on its own, with me just trying to create various moments for myself, whether it’s a happy and uplifting moment like ‘Iced Out Necklace,’ a club moment like ‘Bad Ass Bitches,’ or more serious or soulful moments or segues into things that lyrically I can accomplish.”</p><p>The musician is supporting the record with his current Vinyl Verse Tour, which also features Logic as a co-headliner. Wiz Khalifa announced the tour in April. Special guests on the tour include 24kGoldn, DJ DRAMA, C Dot Castro, and Fedd the God. The 28-city tour began on July 27 at FivePoint Amphitheatre in Irvine and will visit in Houston, Atlanta, Brooklyn, and other cities before concluding on September 2, 2022, at Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre in St. Louis.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Wiz Khalifa 💩 on DJ Mike Danger telling him if he wanna fight they can do it 😲‼️ <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/kpYt9XVZxl</a></p><p>— Black Stone DNA (@BlackStoneDNA1) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">July 31, 2022</a></p><h2>More information about the artist</h2><p>Wiz Khalifa’s first album, Show and Prove, was released in 2006 in cooperation with Warner Bros.
