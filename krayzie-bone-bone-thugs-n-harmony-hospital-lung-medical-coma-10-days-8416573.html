By the time they came to take me to a room, I had used three of those bags,” he tells Spin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Doctors told him in advance that they “had to put me under to see what was going on,” Krayzie Bone recalled. He texted his bandmates that he might not make their scheduled show in Las Vegas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He figured he would be out of the hospital soon enough. But, he says, “I woke up 10 days later.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An artery in his lung had ruptured, and doctors were unable to stop the bleeding.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a>&nbsp;to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“After the second day, the bleeding wouldn’t stop and the doctor started to panic,” he told Spin. “That’s when they told my wife they might want to get the family down here.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“They said they didn’t know if I was going to make it out of there,” he shared.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The bleeding eventually stopped on the fourth day, with doctors keeping Krayzie Bone sedated and intubated for another six days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When I woke up, they told me everything that happened. I had no idea I’d been there for 10 days,” he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When he came to, his groupmates from Bone Thugs-N-Harmony had come to the hospital&nbsp; — along with his family, including his father and brother who had flown in from Cleveland, leaving him to wonder, “Damn, why is everybody so uptight? What the hell is going on?”&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, telling Spin, “The doctors in the ICU, I don’t know if it’s what they see every day, but their outlook was grim. They were like, ‘He might not make it out of here. The lung function on the left side is completely dead. He will need a lung transplant.’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But doctors ultimately decided against the procedure, since Krayzie Bone hit the gym consistently — and performed regularly with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. They decided his lungs were strong enough on their own, and opted to put him on preventative medication to avoid his arteries rupturing again.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Krayzie Bone performs with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony on Nov. 19, 2022.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Scott Dudelson/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The rapper told Spin that he now has mycetoma, which the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Cleveland Clinic</a> defines as a “fungal ball” that can get bigger and block the sinuses, and it may be related to his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>sarcoidosis</a>, as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>American Journal of Roentgenology</a> has said that “Mycetoma formation is a recognized complication of sarcoidosis, with a fungus ball developing.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Tha Crossroads" performer told Spin that although it’s in remission, “the damage [sarcoidosis] did to my lungs is irreversible.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Mayo Clinic</a> defines sarcoidosis as “the growth of inflammatory cells” which are known as granulomas, and most often affects the lungs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Krayzie Bone said he’s now working to regain the 25 lbs. he lost in the hospital with the help of a personal trainer and physical therapy. He said the experience of thinking he was going in for a quick checkup —&nbsp;and coming out 10 days later — has changed his outlook on life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Just seeing how fast everything could change is definitely eye-opening.
